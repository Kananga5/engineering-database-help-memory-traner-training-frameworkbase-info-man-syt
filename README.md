    Agility

    The Agility workstream is focused on deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. These are typically IT-led efforts that rely

    heavily on understanding the broader technical requirements and overall business strategy.

    Based on your assessment results, here are your personalized recommendations and next steps.

    Capabilities: Agility

    H I G H

    Follow these recommendations to build your Agility capabilities.

    Install and configure Tableau Server

    Understanding how your hardware, network, databases, and applications interoperate is the first step in planning your Tableau

    Server installation. Documenting this will give you insight for installation and configuration and ongoing platform operations.

    1. Review the Tableau Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Complete the Enterprise Architecture Survey in the Tableau Blueprint Planner.

    3. Leverage these insights to install and configure Tableau Server. For step-by-step guidance, visit the Tableau Help

    documentation for the Tableau Server products you're implementing.

    4. Explore Server Rapid Start to optimize your server installation. Work with our experts to ensure a successful and stable

    Tableau Server environment with a plan for monitoring the scalable growth of users, content, and interactivity.

    Configure user authentication and authorization for Tableau Server

    To deploy Tableau, you will need to define authentication and authorization protocols for users in your organization.

    1. Review the Authentication and Authorization section of Tableau Blueprint. For more detailed guidance and

    configuration instructions, review the Tableau Server Help documentation on Authentication (Windows | Linux).

    2. Configure either a local identity store or an external identity store at time of install.

    3. Choose a Tableau Server authentication method that is compatible with your identity store.

    Manage Tableau licenses

    Licenses should be managed according to your organization's software license processes for allocating to new Tableau users,

    changing Tableau license levels as analytical skills increase, and reclaiming available Tableau licenses when someone leaves

    the company.

    1. Review the Tableau License Management section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Define a process for allocating licenses to new Tableau users.

    3. Define a process for changing Tableau license levels for current Tableau users.

    4. Define a process for reclaiming Tableau licenses when someone leaves the company.

    5. Enable license management features in your Tableau environment - Login-Based License Management and Grant

    Role on Sign In - and update processes accordingly.

    6. Document this information, and it to your Enablement Intranet.

    Deploy client software (Desktop/Prep Builder)

    Distributing Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder (for Creators) can be done in a few different ways. Determine and

    document the process.

    1. Review the Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Determine if you want to customize the install (e.g., no prompts, inclusion of drivers, etc.) and configure your process

    accordingly.

    3. If virtual desktop support is required, determine how you want to manage license deactivation.

    4. Configure Tableau Desktop license usage reporting to gather usage information for individual instances of Tableau

    Desktop.

    5. Document this information, and it to your Enablement Intranet.

    Configure back-up and restore

    A Tableau Server administrator should perform daily backups of Tableau Server and its data. Taking these steps can help

    ensure that Tableau Server runs with minimum loss.

    1. Review the Back-up and Restore section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Learn how to use the Tableau Services Manager (TSM) command line tool to back-up and restore Tableau data,

    including Tableau Server's own PostgreSQL database, which stores workbook and user metadata, data extract files,

    server configuration data, and log files.

    3. Define a cadence for performing back ups using the TSM command line tool.

    4. Perform back-ups in accordance with your planned cadence.

    Monitor Tableau Server process status

    In order to ensure continued performance, your administrator should have a process in place for monitoring the Tableau

    Server process status and a documented plan of action for when the process is "down" or "status unavailable".

    1. Review the Tableau Server Process Status section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Determine how you will monitor, at minimum, process state changes, especially "Down" and "Status unavailable".

    3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond if a process is not running as expected (e.g., who will support the

    issue, where will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

    4. If you've purchased Tableau Advanced Management, explore the Resource Monitoring Tool to gain a comprehensive

    look at the health of Tableau Server, including process status. Contact your Account Team if you're interested in

    Tableau Advanced Management.

    Monitor Backgrounder jobs

    The Backgrounder process runs server jobs, including extract refreshes, subscriptions, flow runs, and data-driven alerts.

    Administrators and users will want to know when these processes fail so corrective action can be taken.

    1. Review the Built-in Alerts section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on leveraging built-in alerts to monitor for

    background job failures.

    2. Provide enablement to Administrators, and the Creator user base more broadly, on how built-in alerts can be leveraged

    for process failures, such as extract refresh failures, flow run failures, etc.

    3. Provide enablement to Administrators, and the Creator user base more broadly, on how they can reinitiate the process

    manually using, in most cases, "Run Now".

    4. Administrators may also want to develop similar processes using the REST API or tabcmd commands as a fail safe in

    case process owners are out of the office.

    5. Document guidance on how users can review Backgrounder jobs, and post this information to your Enablement

    Intranet.

    Configure built-in alerts

    Alerts provide critical information about platform outages so you can take immediate action to triage the issue, communicate

    with users, etc.

    1. Review the Built-in Alerts section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Configure notifications about system alerts and failures (e.g., process status, drive space constraints, etc.) during

    installation.

    3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond when an alert is triggered (e.g., who will support the issue, where

    will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

    Review performance thresholds

    Administrative views are dashboards that are included with Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud and help you understand system

    utilization and how users are interacting with content so that you can proactively monitor system activity and other scheduled

    tasks.

    1. Review the Administrative Views for Monitoring section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on monitoring performance

    thresholds.

    2. Leverage default or custom administrative views (or utilize the Dashboard Load Times Accelerator on our Tableau

    exchange) to understand how Tableau is performing throughout the day, including background tasks to ensure they are

    executing on time. These views should be leveraged to inform real-time action as well as trend analysis.

    3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond when real-time action is needed (e.g., who will support the issue,

    where will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

    4. Enable your teams by driving best-practice awareness into existing analytics community engagements, such as user

    group meetings, analytics academies, and competitions.

    5. Enact Performance Thresholds that work for your organization. Read more about this process with our blog, How to

    Improve Dashboard Load Times with People and Processes.

    Monitor license utilization

    Monitoring licenses can help you administrators monitor usage and answer questions like who is using licenses, which types of

    licenses they're using and if you need more or fewer licenses.

    1. Review the Administrative Views for Monitoring section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on monitoring license

    utilization.

    2. Define a monthly cadence for reviewing license utilization details, including usage, availability, and upcoming

    expirations.

    3. Review license utilization in accordance with your planned cadence.

    Define an upgrade process, including end-user communications plans

    Defining the when and how on upgrades across all products in the Tableau platform includes decision points around upgrade

    frequency, version selection, and version compatibility. When these areas are addressed early, administrators can better

    manage users' expectations, rather than having to react to business demands for new features and functionality.

    1. Review the Upgrades section Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Define a cadence for performing platform upgrades, including Tableau Server, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, and

    Tableau Bridge.

    3. Develop an enablement plan to prepare users for platform upgrades.

    4. Develop a communications plan to inform users about platform upgrades, leveraging all channels available in your

    organization.

    5. Perform upgrades in accordance with your planned cadence.

    6. Explore Server Upgrade where Tableau experts do the heavy lifting so you can quickly and successful upgrade your

    environment and your team can produce deeper and more relevant findings by taking advantage of Tableau's newest

    features.

    Complete load test and capacity planning

    Load testing helps you understand your Tableau Server’s capacity with respect to your unique environment, data, workload,

    and usage profile. Capacity planning, by contrast, helps you ensure optimal Tableau Server performance and sufficient

    capacity to handle increased workloads.

    1. Review the Load Testing section and Capacity Planning section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Define a cadence for performing load testing. In general, this should be conducted two to four times a year in

    conjunction with upgrades and server scale-up or scale-out expansions.

    3. Define a cadence for performing capacity planning. Depending on the size of your organization, user demand, and

    historical growth rates, you may need to do this at 6-month, quarterly, or monthly intervals.

    4. Perform load testing and capacity planning in accordance with your planned cadence.

    Perform database maintenance

    Data maintenance creates free space on the Tableau Server deployments by deleting old files, including log files, temp files,

    and rows from the http_request table.

    1. Review the Database Maintenance section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Define a cadence for performing database maintenance.

    3. Perform database maintenance in accordance with your planned cadence.

    Deploy Tableau Mobile

    Mobile business intelligence enables any user to make decisions no matter where they are. As a result, you should provide

    users with the ability to access Tableau from anywhere.

    1. Review the Tableau Mobile Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Gather organizational requirements for enterprise apps to better understand how you can control app delivery,

    customize the sign-in experience, configure app policies, and provide additional security and governance controls.

    3. Document guidance on how users can leverage Tableau Mobile, and post this information to your Enablement Intranet.

    Install add-ons and extensions on Tableau Server

    Tableau supports a robust extensibility framework for deep and complex enterprise integrations and embedded analytics

    solutions. Define a process for how you will leverage these capabilities in your environment.

    1. Review the Extensibility section of Tableau Blueprint.

    2. Determine the extent to which you want to install add-ons and extensions to be deployed in the environment.

    3. Document guidance on how users can request the installation of add-ons and extensions, and post this information to

    your Enablement Intranet.

    Get to Know Application Security
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe what an application is.
        Define application security and its role in relation to application development.

    What Is an Application?

    If you’ve ever used a computer, you’ve used an application. To define it, an application is a computer software package that performs one or more tasks and enables direct user interaction. But let’s break down what that really means by looking at examples of applications and how we use them.

    Applications come in many forms such as database programs, web browsers, email clients, spreadsheets, media players, word processors, and image/photo editing software to name a few. Each of these software packages allows a user to interact directly with the application. For example, when you use word processing software, you interact directly with the application when you type, delete, or copy and paste text. And, you interact with applications in different ways—whether it’s on a computer using a photo editing software package like Photoshop, interacting with a mobile app on your smartphone, or conducting business transactions on a web-based banking application. That’s pretty straightforward, right? 

    There are two ways developers create applications. They develop proprietary code that is not shared outside of an organization, or they develop code through open source projects, which are designed and developed in a public, collaborative manner with developers working together. 

    Open source applications grant developers the right to use, study, and change the software, thus allowing it to be adapted and applied to a variety of use cases. There is an entire community dedicated to developing open source projects. As someone who may be interested in becoming an application security engineer, contributing to open source projects is a great way to get practical experience in application development and security while sharpening and proving your skills. As a result, you will better understand how applications are developed and function, and start to understand the role of application security in the coding and software development lifecycle.
    The Role of Application Security

    In an organization’s technology stack, the application layer is the closest layer to the user. It allows interaction with the user and therefore provides the largest attack surface for intruders. Because of this, a relatively large number of security breaches are the result of application vulnerabilities. 

    Applications can also provide a treasure trove of personal data an attacker would love to steal, tamper with, or destroy, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, national identification data (such as Social Security numbers), and email addresses. This means protecting applications is a key part of cybersecurity, in order to minimize the risks of data loss and the resulting negative financial, reputational, privacy, or legal impacts for an organization and its customers. 

    Application security engineers need to think like an attacker to understand how an application could possibly be misused, while also ensuring that input provided by legitimate users is sanitized, validated, and processed safely by the application. 

    Application security engineers focus on protecting applications in order to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive data. Since it is much easier and less expensive to find security flaws in the early stages of software development, application security engineers should gather security requirements before any design or development work begins.

    An engineer is looking through a magnifying glass at a bug on a laptopApplication security engineers work with development teams and business units to help design, create, document, code, test, deploy, and maintain secure applications. The process of designing and building applications is known as the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Application developers are responsible for the documentation and programming (coding) steps in this process. They write the source code that causes an application to carry out its desired tasks. Application security engineers partner with application developers and others throughout the SDLC to protect applications by diagnosing, documenting, and remediating application security vulnerabilities.

    Typically in an organization, an application developer's main objective is to produce working code as quickly as possible to meet business requirements. As a result, writing secure code is sometimes an afterthought. This is where application security engineers can be super helpful by building security into the development process so that sensitive data remains protected. In doing so, they aim to ensure that an application provides what is commonly referred to as CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 

    For example, application security engineers help developers design and deploy the application in a way that requires proper authentication (to protect the confidentiality of data), transfers sensitive information securely to prevent it from being modified (integrity), and ensures that users can access their data (availability). 

    Application security engineers are often embedded within an application development team and serve as advisers to designers and developers. They ensure that application requirements include security considerations, they suggest secure authentication protocols during the design phase, they implement code reviews to check for common security vulnerabilities, they test applications before deployment, and they advise on the timing and methods for patching vulnerabilities.

    In this unit, you learned what an application is and how application development and security functions work together in practice. In the next unit, you learn about the business impact of application security, the skills application security engineers need, and common application security scenarios.

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain the impact of application security on business.
        List the key skills needed to become an application security professional.
        Describe common application security scenarios.

    The Impact of Application Security on Businesses

    Inadequate application security can have huge negative consequences for an organization. Cyber intruders attack a variety of organizations every day in the hope of enriching themselves by extracting money, corporate information, and intellectual property. Attackers use the hijacked data to make unauthorized purchases and steal consumers’ identities. 

    If you follow the news, you know that attackers have successfully compromised applications to access data stored in the computer systems of retailers, credit reporting companies, airlines, entertainment companies, government offices, schools, and many other organizations. In one case, a hotel chain was breached by a foreign country. In another case, a SQL injection attack, which we’ll cover later, installed spyware on a company’s computers which exposed customer credit card information. In multiple cases, intruders stole credit card data by taking advantage of weak data encryption systems. In total, these attacks exposed the personal information of hundreds of millions of customers.

    These security breaches resulted in direct economic impacts from fraud and theft, but a security breach can also yield indirect economic impacts, like the loss of reputation. This can produce additional financial consequences on the business due to a loss of customers, reduced shareholder trust, and damaged brand image. Security breaches can also have legal and regulatory ramifications that result in fines and sanctions. 

    Application security engineers have a critical role to play in ensuring that customer data is adequately protected by business applications. Because the role of an application security engineer is so important, they need to have a wide range of proficiencies. Let’s dig into this a bit more to see what skills an application security engineer needs.
    Application Security Engineer Skills

    Imagine that you’re going to fly to a distant island for a tropical vacation. Before you board your airplane, you must pass through multiple airport security checkpoints. Security personnel check your ID and boarding pass, you walk through a metal detector, your luggage is X-Rayed, you pass airport security dogs, and security guards monitor TV screens to watch for unusual activity. These are layers of security at the airport to ensure that you enjoy a safe trip to your destination. Similar to the security personnel at an airport, an application security engineer must be aware of attacker entry points and provide the necessary safeguards against vulnerabilities at each phase of the application’s development and deployment.

    Airport security personnel check travelers and luggage

    Reports from security associations (ISC)² and Information Systems Security Association International (ISSA) discuss the cyber security skills shortage that has been growing for years. An increase in security incidents has led organizations to report an acute need for application security professionals to protect applications and data. In light of this and the fact that application security engineers require more training, an application security engineer can often earn more money than application developers.

    Application security engineers employ various techniques at different stages of an application’s software development lifecycle (SDLC) to uncover security vulnerabilities. In order to do this, an application security engineer must have a good grasp of many technical skills, which include:

        Threat modeling: Think about how attackers can compromise a system and what protections are needed against them
        Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC): Help developers write secure code that minimizes vulnerabilities by implementing secure coding standards, techniques, and best practices
        Security code reviews: Identify security vulnerabilities in source code before an application is deployed to production
        Vulnerability testing and analysis: Discover weaknesses once an application is deployed and advise development teams on remediation

    Since application security engineers work with various people (application developers, testers, designers, and others), they need to be good collaborators and communicators. They also need to be good writers since they generate documents that explain their technical findings. In some cases, they need to use their persuasive powers to convince management why a certain security feature should be installed before an application is deployed. Often, they must use their critical thinking skills to determine the various ways that an intruder would try to attack an application. Then they need to find creative solutions to thwart potential attacks. If an intrusion occurs, they investigate the incident to help identify the source of the compromise and harden the application against future attacks.

    On top of the skills listed above, the following certifications can bolster an application security engineer’s knowledge.

        GIAC Web Application Defender (GWEB)
        Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP)
        Secure Software Practitioner (SSP)
        Certified Application Security Engineer (CASE)
        Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation 

    If you’re considering a career as an application security professional, earning a college degree in computer science is a good way to start on that path. Application security engineers will often start out as application developers and then transition into the cybersecurity field. Also, multiple colleges offer degrees in cybersecurity. It’s definitely an exciting field with many opportunities.

    Now that you know about the skills you need to be an application security engineer, let's look at what common security scenarios an application security engineer encounters and how to protect applications in these situations.
    Common Application Security Scenarios

    Cybercriminals look for the easiest access to steal, modify, or destroy data that requires the least amount of effort and provides the biggest payback. The more complex an application is, the higher the probability that it contains security vulnerabilities. Applications, especially web applications, are targets of cybercriminals because they present a large and relatively easily exploitable attack surface (the user interface) that can allow an intruder to access sensitive information stored on a computer. Also, intruders do not need any special tools to attack a web application. All they need is a computer and an Internet connection.

    While attackers are trying to figure out how to infiltrate an application, application security engineers are focused on minimizing vulnerabilities in application code and ensuring application components are securely configured in order to prevent unauthorized access to customer accounts and data. A valuable resource to consult when reviewing applications security risks is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). OWASP is an international organization that provides freely available information focused on improving software security.

    So, what are some common risks an application security engineer may encounter? An injection attack is a good example and occurs when there is improper sanitization of application inputs. In an injection attack, an intruder inserts code, instead of expected input data, into the applications input handling logic (the code that manages communication between an end user interface and a database). 

    If the application is written incorrectly, the application will run the code that the attacker injects. For example, structured query language, known commonly as SQL, could be entered into an email address field on a web page. SQL is a language used in programming and is designed to manage data. If there is no check on the input field, an attacker might be able to extract information (like health records) from the application’s database by using the SQL code. 

    To sanitize a user’s input, an application should ensure that the application handles user input as data instead of commands and includes only allowlisted characters (an allowlist is a list of characters that are granted access to a system). When an allowlist is used, all other entities are denied access, except those included in the allowlist, and those that don’t exceed the maximum data field lengths.

    Other responsibilities of application security engineers are reviewing, testing, and verifying code during the development process to ensure user inputs are properly sanitized in order to help prevent against the injection attack described above. This is especially critical in the context of agile software development, which seeks to deliver application functionality faster than other development methods. But the agile method adds complexity because it requires continuous updating of applications to keep up with end-user expectations. Developers are expected to provide new features and fix discovered bugs at a rapid pace. Applications must be hardened to prevent exploits, and it's the application security engineer’s job to advise the development team on the most efficient way of doing so.

    Weak, or nonexistent, encryption is another prevalent application security shortcoming that can allow attackers to expose sensitive data. Applications are vulnerable when they use protocols like HTTP that transmit data as clear text. Instead, applications should use secure protocols like HTTPS that encrypt data transmissions, so the data can’t be read without the proper decryption key. Old, weak encryption algorithms and internally developed encryption functions should be avoided. Instead, application security engineers should rely on secure, standards-based encryption algorithms.

    Application security engineers help developers follow a Secure SDLC process. They adopt secure application design and architecture techniques based on well-known security practices, which include providing strong authentication and authorization and employing secure session management to prevent unauthorized access. 

    Application security engineers deploy applications that prevent users from logging in with default credentials, since this is a common attack vector. They sanitize user input to hinder injection attacks. Some data breaches have succeeded due to weak encryption, so application security engineers use strong algorithms with appropriate encryption key management to encrypt data transmissions and stored data (data at rest). Then if attackers infiltrate the system, they can’t extract any useful information since they won’t know how to decrypt the data. 

    Application security engineers ensure that errors are handled properly so that no sensitive information is released to the user. They also perform static and dynamic application security testing during and after application development and monitor the application for any unusual activity after deployment.
    Sum It Up

    In this unit, we covered how an application security breach can impact a business, what skills application security engineers need, and explored common application security scenarios. Next, let’s discuss the first step every good application security engineer takes: identifying the applications in their environment, and their associated risks.

    Understand Network Security
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe what a network is.
        Identify ways people and assets access a network.
        Explain network security engineering.

    What Is a Network?

    A network is a fabric of interconnected elements that are related to each other. We encounter a variety of networks on a daily basis. Networks allow us to travel, to connect with other people, to view entertainment content, to collect and disburse information, and so much more. Similarly, a computer network connects two or more computers with various devices in order to share resources among people and other computers. Computer networks consist of many devices: servers, routers, computers, printers, scanners, and so on. We access computer networks to check social media, read email, review our bank account balance, and perform countless other functions.

    In this module, we get to know Jim and Florence who are network security professionals. We learn about their job responsibilities, plus the skills they need and the tools they use to protect computer networks from potential security threats.

    A phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop are connected to a Wi-Fi network.
    How People and Devices Access a Network

    Because we live in an interconnected world, it’s important to understand how computer network access works. It’s also imperative that we protect these networks since we rely on them every day. Let’s look at how encryption and authentication help to protect networks.

    Some computer networks are public and some are private. A public computer network allows anybody to connect to it. You access a public computer network whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot at a coffee shop or inside an airport. A private computer network has restricted access. It allows only certain people and devices to connect to it. In this way, a private network regulates who and what can access its resources. Businesses operate private networks that allow their employees to communicate with each other and access internal, company-related information.

    Since we don’t want just anybody to access our personal information, like our bank account balance, websites use authentication and encryption to protect network access and data transfers. To check your account balance, your bank requires that you prove who you are—this is authentication.

    Encryption converts data from standard text into coded data that is not humanly readable. This ensures that nobody else can retrieve your private data that is being transmitted across a public computer network. Websites use encryption to protect the information that’s passed between your device, for example, your cell phone and your bank. Many websites use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to encrypt data. 

    Now let’s check in with Florence. She’s a network security engineer at a large bank that serves customers in multiple countries. Part of Florence’s job is to ensure that only an authorized account holder can access his or her account. Her bank adopted an authentication process that requires the account holder to provide a username and password, or a debit card and a PIN (personal identification number), to log in to their account.

    Florence also implemented multi-factor authentication, known as MFA. To access their account with MFA, a customer provides their username/password and is then required to verify their identity with an additional authentication factor, such as an authenticator app or security key. MFA provides an added layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access to bank accounts.
    Understand Network Security

    We expect computer networks to be available and secure 24 hours a day so we can access them whenever and wherever we want. When computer networks are unavailable, it affects how we conduct our daily lives. If your bank’s computer system is unavailable, you may be unable to pay your bills (ouch!) or transfer funds to the appropriate account.

    Because of the massive amount of personal, health, financial, and other data stored on computer networks, securing public and private computer networks is essential. As a result, network security professionals build multiple layers of security into their computer systems to provide what is commonly referred to as CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

    Many types of people may try to gain unauthorized access to a computer network. These range from hackers who want to gain access for fun or fame, to cybercriminals who want to steal money and information, to cyberterrorists who want to disrupt and damage.

    As a network security engineer at a medical clinic, Jim knows health records are a prime target for cybercriminals. Any security breach can have legal and regulatory ramifications resulting in fines and sanctions. To minimize those risks, Jim uses hardware and software tools that provide added layers of protection for patients.

    While Jim is aware that external cybercriminals want to attack his systems, he knows that threats can also arise internally from intentional and unintentional actions by employees or other authorized users. This can arise from a malicious insider (like a disgruntled employee) or accidental deletion by an uninformed user. Because of this, it’s critical that he knows his system configuration and typical usage patterns so he can recognize potential security threats. In many cases, internal attacks are often accidental occurrences, so the best way to deal with them is through cybersecurity education and awareness for all employees.

    Stadium ticket takers check tickets as sports fans wait in line.

    In the end, it’s the network security professional’s job to ensure a computer system’s CIA by keeping out unwanted intruders while providing authorized access to those who need it. Network security professionals are not always the most popular people in an organization because the security measures that they employ can make network access a bit of a challenge. Think of their job as being similar to a stadium ticket taker. This person causes a slowdown in the stadium entry process that can result in ticket holders having to wait in line. But the ticket takers fill an important role by ensuring that each person who enters the stadium has a valid ticket.

    Describe the Healthcare Technology Landscape
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe the healthcare technology landscape.
        Identify the main goals of healthcare industry organizations.
        Define key healthcare technologies.
        Define key cybersecurity terms used in the healthcare industry. 

    What Is Healthcare Technology?

    Most people use healthcare technology (healthtech) every day even if they don’t know it. From wearable devices such as smartwatches that track heart rate to the Internet of Things (IoT) to track insulin levels in diabetes patients, healthtech’s use is widespread and continues to grow at a rapid pace. But what is healthtech and why is it important?

    Healthtech is the use of technologies developed for the purpose of improving all aspects of healthcare. These technologies include digital devices, software, and tools designed to support healthcare organizations, doctors, and patients, with the goal of enabling people to access, exchange, and manage healthcare information electronically. 

    A woman holds a mobile phone with a first aid kit symbol, and is surrounded by circles depicting a smartwatch with a blood pressure measurement.

    Healthtech improves patients’ quality of care by increasing the productivity and efficiency of hospitals and other healthcare organizations. By turning over recurring and monotonous tasks to powerful computers, the technology lessens the burden on healthcare professionals and allows them to focus their goals on improving healthcare for all.
    Goals of Healthcare Organizations

    When it comes to quality healthcare, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. In fact, personalization and customization are key as no two people are alike. Tailoring everything from medication to exercise regimens amplifies human health. Healthtech is such a transformative practice that its impacts are causing a lasting change across the globe.

    In general, healthtech aims to:

        Improve the patient experience.
        Improve people’s health.
        Reduce the per-person cost of healthcare. 

    Healthtech supports these aims by expanding options for medical treatments while transforming how medical professionals execute their jobs. It also provides patients with tools for managing their health independently and together with their healthcare practitioners.

    As an enabler of the medical profession principle, “First, do no harm,” healthtech introduces new technologies that, when properly secured, increase patient health by reducing medication errors and improving compliance. For example, pharmacists can use healthtech to improve patient safety by identifying prescription drug conflicts through data correlation of a patient’s allergies with prescribed medications. Healthcare practitioners can use healthtech to access and update patient health records and exchange patient care data with colleagues rapidly for collaboration efforts, secondary opinions, and evaluations.
    Key Healthcare Technologies

    Healthtech is already becoming integrated into every fabric of the healthcare industry from administrative processes to cancer research and drug development. Healthcare practitioners can leverage these technologies to make the patient experience as painless as possible while improving overall human health. Let’s take a closer look at some healthtech applications in the areas of administrative processes, drug development, surgery, IoT, and telehealth.

    Administrative Technologies

    Administrative technologies allow hospitals and healthcare organizations to manage their growing administrative workloads and tasks such as scheduling and documenting patient care. Let’s look at a few of these technologies.

        Artificial intelligence (AI) streamlines patient workflows by calculating wait times and predicting peak busy hours thus enabling improved scheduling and prioritization of appointments.
        Electronic medical records (EMR) emulate a patient’s paper chart and contain the patient’s medical and treatment history from one medical practice into a digital version.
        Electronic health records (EHR) contain the totality of a patient’s health record, consist of the patient’s EMR from multiple doctors, and represent a long-term view of a patient's health in digital form. 

    Drug Development Technologies

    The pharmaceutical industry leans heavily on AI and machine learning (ML) to power a new wave of drug research and development by automating manual tasks such as combining certain chemicals to create the optimal drug.

    Surgical Technologies

    Surgical and recovery times are drastically reduced thanks to numerous technologies. Let’s look at a few common applications.

        Robotics removes the dependence of solely onsite doctors for care. Robotic surgical assistants are often used in tandem with an onsite doctor to perform processes from non-invasive procedures to open-heart surgery.
        Virtual reality (VR) allows aspiring surgeons the use of augmented VR (a real-life view of an experience projected onto a screen) to gain experience on conducting several different types of surgeries or practicing new surgical techniques.
        Three-dimensional (3D) printing increases the number of available organs for transplants. 3D printing is changing the world of organ transplants by allowing for the substitution of certain organs and artificial tissue with 3D printed solutions to replace or repair damage or structures in the body. 

    IoT Technologies

    IoT consists of a network of internet-connected objects able to collect and exchange data. The technology offers new opportunities for healthcare professionals to monitor patients, as well as patients to monitor themselves. Some examples of these health monitoring devices include connected inhalers and glucose monitoring.

        Connected inhalers help treat conditions such as asthma by monitoring a patient's frequency of attacks and collecting environmental data for their healthcare provider to understand what triggered the attack. These inhalers also alert patients if they leave inhalers at home or when they use the inhaler improperly.
        Glucose monitoring in diabetic patients has traditionally been difficult. Patient's have to manually check and record their glucose regularly often at inconvenient times. These checks typically represent a snapshot in time. IoT devices for glucose monitoring provide continuous, automatic monitoring of glucose levels and eliminate the need for manual record keeping, while alerting patients when their glucose levels are problematic. 

    Remote Patient Monitoring and Telehealth 

    These are probably the most common applications of healthcare IoT devices. These devices automatically collect health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, or temperature from implanted or wearable medical devices from patients not physically present in a healthcare facility. Software applications manage, save, and forward the collected data to a medical professional anywhere in the world where an internet connection and access to the application exist.

    Healthcare Cybersecurity Terminology

    With all these advancements in healthtech, cybersecurity has become more vital than ever for the healthcare sector. Yet cybersecurity threats to the healthcare industry are rapidly on the rise. Financially motivated criminal organizations and other threat actors continue to target the healthcare industry with ransomware attacks and data theft, which puts patient safety and privacy at risk. It’s therefore critical to view cybersecurity as a patient safety issue, enterprise risk, and strategic priority. Before we dive a bit deeper into these threats and risks, let’s learn about a few cybersecurity related terms the healthcare industry uses.

    Get to Know the Energy and Utilities Industries
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe the energy and utilities industry.
        Discuss the current energy and utilities industry outlook. 

    The Energy Industry at a Glance

    Before the industrial revolution, our energy needs were modest. For heat, we relied on the sun, or we burned wood and straw. For transportation, horses gave us mobility, and wind in our sails helped us explore the world.

    For a hundred years, energy consumers had one option for service. Utility companies didn’t have to compete for customers, and customers couldn’t shop around for utility services. Utilities offered one service, electricity, and everyone wanted it.

    Today, many customers have different options, including the type and source of energy they buy, and whom they buy it from. They can shop for rates and energy-efficient appliance rebates to suit their energy needs.

    In a deregulated market, customers enjoy greater freedom in shopping for utility services, because deregulation increases competition, and competition multiplies customer choice. This means multiple utility companies compete to provide better services to customers. As they say, competition in a market is always good for customers.

    Add customer demand to this. Today’s customer expects to engage their utility provider for other reasons, not just to report outages to the call center. Customers now want digital services such as:

        Status updates through social media
        Online bill payment
        Incentives and offers over self-service mobile channels 

    In fact, customers want to be informed through all available communication channels, such as text, email, and social media.

    They no longer depend solely on utilities for their energy needs, because they can get their energy from non-utility companies too. For instance, some tech and automobile companies are also offering utility services to consumers like never before.

    Consumers can also generate electricity themselves by using solar panels and wind turbines. So, utilities aren’t only competing with non-utility companies but also customers to own the energy-customer relationship.

    Most of the earth’s population relies on electricity, gas, and water supply. For this reason, the opportunities to serve billions of customers with better and faster services are endless.
    Energy and Utilities Industry Outlook

    The global energy and utilities industry includes three major categories of natural resources: electricity, natural gas, and water. The industry is responsible for the safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable generation, transmission, and distribution of these resources. The key industry segments are:

        Generation
        Transmission and distribution
        Customer or retail
        Water distribution
        Natural gas transmission and distribution 

    A power plant, solar panels, windmills, transmission tower, and a house.

    A value chain is the complete set of activities starting from energy generation, transmission, marketing, and finally distribution to retailers and customers. An efficient value chain creates economic value for customers, employees, and society at large.

    You need a robust distribution network to guarantee a stable supply of energy to customers. Energy production, marketing, and promotion are activities that are now open to competition. However, power distribution is still a cost-managed monopoly business in most parts of the world. Government-owned entities usually manage the power distribution business, which has a slightly different value chain compared to the privately managed ones.

    Renewable energy has been gaining momentum in the electricity industry as the infrastructure and logistics for generating electricity from renewable sources become cheaper and more accessible. Renewable energy uses naturally replenished sources, such as the sun, wind, water, the earth’s heat, and plants. Renewable energy plays an important role in the world’s energy security and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

    The energy and utilities industry faces several challenges, such as:

        New and more stringent regulations
        Nuclear vulnerability in some countries
        Security-related issues around the transport of raw materials 

    To grow in these conditions, companies must digitally transform, reorganize, and change their action plans. This means investing in new technologies and methodologies, including information analytics.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Identify the different types of utilities.
        Describe the types of utility, energy, and waste companies. 

    Utilities Basics

    Take a look at the three types of utility products and how utility companies work to produce the products and transport them to customers.
    Electricity

    Electricity starts with generation. Traditional power generators are utilities that produce electricity from fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy sources.

    This image shows the electricity production and distribution process.

    The electricity production and distribution process.

    After power is generated, it’s often transformed from low to high voltage, so that transmission lines can efficiently carry it over long distances. When power nears its final destination, distribution transformers convert high-voltage power back to low voltage and deliver it to customers at end usage points. Some large commercial and industrial customers draw power directly from transmission lines.

    In some markets, customers create their own power using distributed energy resources (DER) systems. DERs are small-scale power generation or storage systems located close to where the electricity is used, such as in a home or business.

    Energy retailers, also called vertically integrated utilities depending on the market, sell electricity to customers. Some customers generate and store their electricity on-site with photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, electric vehicles (EV), and microgrids. They can also sell their energy back to utilities.
    Gas

    Natural gas is a nonrenewable hydrocarbon gas used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. The natural gas production journey involves several complex stages. First, companies extract fossil fuels and biofuels. Next, they process the fuels using odorification, compression, metering, and finally liquefaction. Lastly, companies sell the processed gas to the commodity market.

    This image shows the production and distribution process of natural gas.

    The natural gas production and distribution process.

    Transmission networks move high-pressure gas to large industrial customers, gas-powered electricity generators, or storage. Storage facilities hold the gas reserves.

    Distribution companies receive gas from transmission companies and deliver it to their customers. Depending on the market, distribution companies sometimes operate as a regulated monopoly or a competitive retail company. In a competitive gas market, retailers and gas suppliers sometimes purchase gas from the distributors and pay them to ship it to the customer's premises.
    Water

    In this image, observe how water is sourced and distributed to customers. The image also shows how utilities collect wastewater from customers and send it for treatment.

    The water-sourcing and distribution process.

    Utilities source water from rivers and reservoirs, water-treatment plants, and service reservoirs by abstraction and treatment. They store the treated water in storage facilities before transporting it to customers.

    Similar to gas, in a deregulated water market, a retailer or utility company purchases water from the distributor and pays them to ship it through a clean water network for household or commercial consumption. The retailer has contracts with the customer and is responsible for billing water consumption and waste discharge. Wastewater is sent back into the system through a wastewater network for treatment and storage at sewage or sludge-treatment facilities.
    Types of Utility, Energy, and Waste Companies

    Now that you know more about how utilities function, examine the players that serve the utility service needs of customers. This section focuses on the electricity industry, but the gas and water industries have similar counterparts.
    Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Companies

    Power generation, transmission, and distribution companies specialize in creating, transmitting, and distributing energy and utilities.

    A power plant, electricity transmission tower, electricity distribution pole, and a transformer.

    Power generation companies generate electric power from primary sources of energy, such as solar, wind, nuclear, coal, oil, and natural gas. For utilities in the electric power industry, power generation is the stage before storage or delivery to customers through transmission, distribution, and so forth.

    Transmission companies specialize in the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site to an electrical substation. At this point, distribution companies take over using interconnected lines known as a transmission network. The combined transmission and distribution network is commonly known as the Grid in North America and the National Grid in the United Kingdom, India, Tanzania, Myanmar, Malaysia, and New Zealand. Transmission companies are often combined with or serve as distribution companies.

    Distribution companies deliver electric power by carrying electricity from the transmission system to individual customers. Distribution substations connect to the high-voltage transmission system and use transformers to lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV.
    Electric Suppliers and Retailers

    Electric suppliers and retailers are companies that buy electricity from the commodity market and sell it to customers. In many countries, the electricity market has been deregulated to open up the supply of electricity to competition. The role of electricity retailing has changed from administrative in integrated utilities to revenue-generation and risk-management in today’s competitive electricity market.

    Electricity retailers now offer their customers fixed or variable prices for electricity and manage the risk involved in purchasing electricity from spot markets or electricity pools. In a deregulated market, also called a competitive or liberalized energy market, customers can:

        Choose from several competing electricity suppliers.
        Purchase electricity sourced from renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar.
        Buy other related products and services. 

    Electric Cooperatives

    Electric cooperatives (co-ops), are private, nonprofit utility businesses owned by the customers they serve. Co-ops provide at-cost electric service and are governed by an elected board of directors. The two types of cooperatives include distribution cooperatives and generation and transmission (G&T) cooperatives.

        Distribution cooperatives deliver electricity to their member-owners.
        G&Ts provide wholesale power to distribution co-ops through their own generation or by purchasing power on behalf of the distribution members. 

    Co-ops are typically established in rural areas that don’t have an investor-owned or municipal utility nearby to supply electric power. Examples of electric cooperatives include Great Lakes Energy Cooperative in Michigan and Dixie Power in Utah.
    Energy Services Companies

    Energy services companies (ESCOs) design, develop, build, and arrange financing for projects that save energy, reduce energy costs, and decrease operations and maintenance costs at their customers’ facilities. In general, ESCOs act as project developers for a comprehensive range of energy conservation measures (ECMs) and assume the technical and performance risks associated with a project.
    Investor-Owned Utilities

    Investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are privately owned electricity and natural gas providers that aim to produce a return for investors. IOUs distribute profits to stockholders or reinvest the profits. A public utilities commission regulates and sets the rate with some customer participation. IOUs purchase power through contracts and also have their own generation facilities. They’re the largest type of electric utility and have a complex mix of customers. Examples of IOUs include FirstEnergy in Ohio and Pacific Gas & Electric in California.
    Public Utilities

    Public or municipality-owned utilities are nonprofit local government agencies. They provide services to communities that recover costs and earn additional returns. Public utilities use the returns to invest in new facilities. Locally elected officials or public employees manage public utilities.

    Public utilities can return excess funds to customers through reduced rates, community contributions, and increased operational efficiencies. The utility governing body or city council sets the rates. Public utilities operate their own generation facilities or buy power through contracts. Examples of public utilities include Breckenridge Public Utilities in Minnesota and Burlington Electric Department in Vermont.
    Summary

    In this unit, you learned about the different types of utility products and how utility companies produce and distribute their products. You also got to know that many types of utility companies operate worldwide, including investor-owned, municipality-owned, and cooperatives. These companies strive to meet the energy, gas, water, and waste needs of communities.

    In the next unit, you learn how these companies operate within their markets.

    Discover Market Models and Their Impact on Utilities
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain the different types of global utility market models.
        Discuss the challenges that utilities face today.
        Describe the impact of processes required by key business units. 

    Types of Global Utility Market Models

    Energy markets across the world are in the middle of a revolution, triggered by decarbonization and fueled by innovation. Some countries have introduced energy deregulation and competition into energy markets, which has led to the creation of new types of energy markets. Here’s a look at some of the globally recognized energy market models.
    Regulated

    A stamp and document symbol.

    Utility companies in regulated markets, often called vertically integrated utilities, must show a return on investment or a benefit for the money they spend. In a regulated market, the utility companies own the infrastructure, which includes electric transmission lines and all the associated equipment, such as power poles, power lines, and transformers. These utility companies often generate or purchase electricity and sell it to customers.
    Regulated with Competition

    A stamp, document, and people symbol.

    Utilities in a regulated competitive market are similar to regulated utilities, but they face some level of energy supplier competition. This type of market model often caters to the customer base with higher usage or demand.

    Some regulated markets support a level of energy supplier competition. Utilities in regulated markets are often considered vertically integrated, which means they have a monopoly over the sale of power to their customers. But in many regions, utilities offer limited choices for some customer segments. Examples of such regions in the US include California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, and Virginia.

    Sometimes residential customers buy power from the community or renewable-energy suppliers. In many cases, commercial and industrial (C&I) customers with high usage and demand buy power from energy suppliers that can meet their operational budgets and sustainability goals with clean energy.
    Transitioning

    A book with forward arrow transition symbol.

    Transitioning markets are now open to full-scale competition. However, these markets haven’t fully separated or unbundled all of the existing entities of the previously regulated market. Entities include generation, transmission, distribution, and retail.
    Competitive

    A document and people symbol.

    Competitive markets are also known as deregulated energy markets. In a competitive market, utility companies own and maintain the transmission infrastructure and distribute electricity, while other companies compete to supply and sell electricity and gas to customers.

    In a deregulated market, vertically integrated companies are split into multiple independent companies that focus on a specific aspect of the market. For example, a single vertically integrated utility company is split into generation, transmission and distribution, and energy supply companies, though this varies between markets. Additionally, services such as meter asset management and meter ownership are sometimes split into separate companies.

    The goals of energy deregulation typically include breaking up monopolies and encouraging energy supplier competition. This gives customers more options and encourages price competition. A successful deregulated market has some churn because customers mostly shop for competitive rates and offers that fit their needs and lifestyles.
    Challenges Facing Utilities

    The energy and utilities industries face many obstacles due to the current business environment. Consolidation is creating an increasing need to integrate, merge, and reconcile business-support systems. Here’s an overview of the industry environment and the challenges it presents.
    Deregulation

    Around the world, countries have introduced energy deregulation and competition into energy markets to democratize the energy and utilities industry and provide customers with choices. The more competitive a market, the more pressure on utilities to gain and retain customers.

    Deregulation:

        Increases customer choice and energy supplier competition to encourage competitive energy pricing.
        Unbundles generation, transmission, distribution, supply, and customer service.
        Helps break up monopolies over the end-to-end elements of electricity, gas, and water supply. 

    Aging Infrastructure and Workforce

    Along with competitive pressure, the energy and utilities sector is at an inflection point. Aging infrastructure needs replacement, and a new generation is entering the workforce. In addition to the physical infrastructure, aging and inflexible customer information systems (CIS) and billing systems can no longer handle the data and security requirements of changing markets.
    Retail Competition’s Effect on Energy Rates

    Competitive markets lead to price competition, and the commercial and industrial segments benefit the most. Even customers using default services provided by utilities in competitive regions still benefit from competitive markets, because competition leads to more choices.
    Climate Change and Environmental Responsibility

    Everybody's talking about climate change. The implementation of energy savings and efficiency measures, and the use of renewable energies, are constantly increasing. That’s why utility companies must rethink their strategies and shift their operations to reach greater levels of environmental stewardship and protection. When it comes to finding new ways to generate energy through sustainable processes, it’s now or never.

    Furthermore, energy sustainability measures open the door to major economic benefits. Sustainability measures can help generate mass amounts of information with valuable consumption and generation data to bring down costs.
    Digital Transformation

    Digital adoption and rapid technological change are forcing utilities to rethink their current business models, including how they work and the services they provide. To achieve greater sustainability and higher energy savings, utilities have to implement digitization strategies that facilitate the design, implementation, and operation of new sustainable technologies in which customers play a starring role.

    Customers expect to have a more fluid and personalized experience. What’s more, they want more information, with detailed data on their rates and consumption. Utilities must make their strategies customer-centric and digitize their processes and tools.
    Key Business Units and Processes

    The rules of the energy industry are changing as utilities embrace new technologies and customers gain more control over products. Examine some of the impacts of changes to business processes on customers and key business units.

    Accounting Rules Changes: Information Services

    Often, utilities in regulated markets are unable to capitalize on the money they spend on services in the same way that they can for capital equipment. Because regulated markets lack competition, utilities haven’t prioritized information services, such as cloud-computing solutions to support their business processes. However, this is changing as some utilities acknowledge the benefits provided by software as a service (SaaS).
    Utility Rules Changes: Who Creates Energy?

    Now customers really do have power, their own power. With rooftop solar, electric vehicles, batteries, and microgrids, customers can sell their power back to the grid. They can also get paid by utilities to reduce their consumption or use stored energy when grid capacity is strained.

    Distributed energy resources are a consideration and even a concern for grid operators who fear the impact of losing customers. But, if utilities and customers are aligned, distributed energy resources can work to the advantage of both utilities and customers to:

        Regulate the flow of electricity.
        Transition to cleaner energy.
        Keep the grid safe and secure.
        Reduce energy costs. 

    Grid Changes: Moving to Multidirectional

    Grid evolution is driving the need for cloud platforms because as the energy grid becomes more distributed and multidirectional, the enterprise platforms required to manage this flow of data and transactions must adapt.

    In the past, power flowed one way, and the system was focused on safe, reliable, and affordable power. New and disruptive innovations, such as distributed energy resources, are changing this. Power now flows two ways. Energy can be mobile and the computing needs to manage everything are far greater. New digital energy cloud platforms, such as Salesforce, are filling that need.

    Learn Common Utility Processes, Services, and Units of Measure
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain the common utility service processes.
        Describe the common customer notifications.
        Describe the energy and utilities units of measure.
        Define the pricing and quoting terms for various energy and utility commodities. 

    Common Energy and Utilities Service Processes

    Apart from delivering energy products to customers, utilities also provide additional services to make customers’ service experience better. Here are the most common energy and utilities service processes for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) customers.

    Examples of energy and utility services provided to the customers.
    Manage Communication Preferences and Services

    With so many channels of communication available, good customer service tailors the communication method to customer preferences. Whether it’s incoming or outgoing communications, utilities must manage their customer communications efficiently so that customers get what they need in a way that’s convenient for them.

    People and businesses move and change. Customer service agents communicate regularly with individuals who are moving to a different house and need their service changed. Agents also work with businesses that plan to move to a different location.

    Customers who own multiple properties need to organize their utilities efficiently. Easy access to real-time information and customer service are important to property managers.
    New Programs and Energy Services

    New programs and energy services are exciting topics for many customers and a chance for companies to build relationships. They share information with customers about new programs, such as solar, electric vehicles, batteries, and related offers and rebates.
    Bill Inquiry and Payment Assistance

    Customers sometimes call to ask questions about their bill or to submit a meter reading, but this need not be the end of the conversation. With the right tools, customer service agents can use this time to build a relationship with the customer. This includes suggesting ways for the customer to save or manage energy, which can help them save money.

    Customer service agents also reach out to customers about payments and sometimes about nonpayment of bills. This can lead to conversations about payment and collections assistance.
    Service Outage, Safety, and Service Callout

    Service outage and safety issue notifications are two-way communications. Customers can report a service outage or safety issue, and utilities can communicate a planned or unplanned service outage or safety issue to customers through several channels.

    When an equipment malfunctions, companies dispatch workers to the site to make repairs. Service can be planned or unplanned, and utilities inform the customers about any potential outages and expected restoration times.
    New Rates and Construction

    Whether fixed or variable, rates change from time to time. New rates and rate changes are sometimes available by choice or mandate. Customer service agents regularly reach out to customers about changes and rate choices through calls and digital channels.

    A lot goes on at new construction sites and not just for the general contractor. Utilities carry out many different actions at new construction sites, which they manage on a schedule to avoid disruptions in construction.
    Common Customer Notifications

    Now that you know the various common customer service tasks, it’s time to learn more about the common customer notifications.

    Examples of the service notifications that customers expect from utilities.
    Account Activation and Deactivation Services

    Customers sometimes move in and out of a utility’s service area, and they occasionally switch to a competitor as well. With current trends, it’s more common than ever for customers to contact their utilities to add, switch, and deactivate service.
    Welcome Communications

    When a new customer joins a utility service, it’s important to start the customer relationship with a communication to welcome them onboard. Examples include welcome calls, gifts, and emails.
    Electronic Fund Transfer Confirmations

    With identity theft on the rise, many customers are setting up regular notifications through their banks. Offering customers the option to set up electronic funds transfer (EFT) confirmations with the utilities helps build customer trust.
    Payment Reminders and Overdue Notices

    With busy schedules, sometimes customers overlook or forget to pay their bills. They like reminders to help them avoid additional fees and hits to their credit scores.
    Rate Change Notifications and Tariff Notices

    While this type of notification is sometimes mandated, utility customers on variable rates run their businesses to maximize output and minimize costs. So, it’s important to know the rates at all times. Some rates vary in price by time of day or usage, and customers want to know when they cross a threshold into a higher rate or price.
    Outage or Restoration Notifications

    Regardless of whether you service individual customers or businesses, it’s important for everyone experiencing an outage to know when repairs are underway and when service is restored. Often, outage notices include an estimated time of restoration.
    Crew Mobilization Notices

    Whenever there’s a service disruption, it’s important to notify customers. Companies must also notify all crew members to mobilize and restore service. Mobilization notices alert crews when they must repair damage or perform services.
    Customer Satisfaction Surveys

    As with any type of customer, utility customers don’t always share when they’re unhappy. So, it’s important to reach out to customers occasionally, to determine their level of satisfaction and improvement areas.
    Energy Product Measurements

    Guess what utility companies do before selling their commodities? If you said measure and price their products, you get a gold star. Learn about some of the primary energy units of measure and pricing terms.

    Electricity Units of Measure

    An energy unit used for electrical power, particularly for utility bills, is the kilowatt-hour (kWh), with one kilowatt-hour equivalent to 3.6 megajoules. Electricity usage is measured in units of kilowatt-hours per year or another time period. This is a measurement of average power consumption, meaning the average rate at which energy is transferred. One kilowatt-hour per year is about 0.11 watts.
    Natural Gas Units of Measure

    Natural gas is often sold in units of energy content or by volume. The most commonly used units of measure for gas are gas cubic feet or meters. Ccf or one hundred cubic feet and Mcf or one thousand cubic feet are used to measure large volumes of natural gas.
    Water, Wastewater, and Waste Units of Measure

    Water and wastewater are measured in gallons, cubic feet or meters, or centum cubic feet (CCF). Waste charges can be measured by weight or volume in skips, bins, dumpsters, or other containers, depending on the content of the waste.
    Energy and Utilities Pricing and Quoting Terms

    Energy and utility companies employ usage pricing extensively. The four subtypes of pricing include unit rate, standing charge, interval pricing, and Flex pricing.
    Summary

    In this unit, you learned how utilities communicate with their customers and how customer expectations are changing rapidly. You got to know about some of the common notifications that utilities send to their customers. In the end, you also learned about the various energy units of measure and pricing terms.

    In the next unit, you learn about the transformative shifts in the energy market and the impact of distributed energy resources and demand-side management.

    Explore Market Pressures and Transformative Shifts
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Define the four Ds of energy transformation.
        Explain the factors driving digital transformation for energy and utility companies.
        Describe the impact of distributed energy resources and demand-side management on the energy market. 

    The Four Ds of Energy Transformation

    Transformative shifts are taking place in the energy and utilities industries, including deregulation, decentralization, and distributed energy resources (DER). Moreover, decarbonization, digitalization, and demand-side management are intensifying the shift. Energy transformation is defined by four Ds: decarbonization, deregulation, digitalization, and decentralization. Here’s a closer look at each of these processes.
    Decarbonization

    The carbon dioxide formula with arrows pointing downward.

    Decarbonization is the move to cleaner energy and conservation behavior. This move changes the technologies used to generate power, such as wind and solar. In turn, the changes impact the infrastructure of the business as well as the products available to customers. Types of products resulting from decarbonization include green energy and renewable-based products. As a result, these changes affect customer-facing sales and service opportunities.
    Deregulation

    A scissor cutting a ribbon.

    Deregulated markets are moving away from verticalized utilities. Thanks to this shift, new market models are emerging in which nontraditional energy companies can now own the energy-customer relationship. As a result, traditional utility companies need new products and systems to support existing products and compete successfully. This means increased demands on their systems.
    Digitalization

    A document with an arrow pointing to a laptop screen.

    Digitalization includes using the cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data to build smarter, more responsive grids, with an additional focus on customer behavior. Customers are now used to the sophisticated digital services offered in other industries and expect the same from their utility companies. You learn more about digital transformation later in this unit.
    Decentralization

    A circle with arrows going outward and pointing to smaller circles.

    With more on-site customer generation and distributed energy resources, such as solar power, EVs, microgrids, and battery storage, customers have more choice and power over the grid than ever. While this seems positive for customers, it places a new and increased burden on keeping a utility’s infrastructure safe, as the utility no longer owns, maintains, or physically controls all the energy resources that are now part of its energy grid.
    What’s Driving Digital Transformation?

    As the energy industry evolves, customer expectations and utility innovations become increasingly varied. Take a look at some of the questions utilities ask as they try to meet the demands of the new-age energy industry.
    Customer Expectations and Value

    As a utility company, how do I keep up? How do I personalize my products and communications for my vastly diverse customer base? How do I meet the customers where they want to be and anticipate their needs? How do I provide true value to my customers?
    Digital-First, Work-from-Anywhere, Real-Time

    How do I deliver a digital-first experience for my customers and employees, connecting them from anywhere? Can I be agile enough? Can I generate insights and enable actions in real time that are valuable to my customers and that support our business objectives?
    Disruptive Regulatory and Technology Change

    How will the industry landscape look in a competitive market, with new distributed, democratized, and decarbonized energy programs? How do I use IoT, smart devices, meters, and VPPs or networks to maximize grid, customer, and business value? What’s my place in new energy market models?

    Salesforce solutions support all types of utility market models across the globe and are flexible enough to meet the different expectations and innovations of each market.
    Impact of Distributed Energy Resources

    DERs are electrical generation and storage facilities that consist of a variety of small, grid-connected, or distribution-system-connected devices. Distributed generation and storage enable the collection of energy from many sources, lower environmental impacts, and improve the security of supply.

    A windmill, solar panel, and battery.

    Conventional power stations, such as coal-fired and gas stations, nuclear-powered plants, hydroelectric dams, and large-scale solar power stations, are centralized and often transmit electric energy over long distances.

    In contrast to conventional power stations, DER systems are decentralized, modular, and use flexible technologies that are located close to the load they serve. However, DERs have capacities of only 10 megawatts (MW) or less. Multiple generation and storage components can form these systems, which are sometimes referred to as hybrid power systems.

    DER systems typically use renewable energy sources, such as hydro, biomass, biogas, sun, wind, and geothermal. DERs play an important role in the electric power distribution system as the energy industry moves towards renewable energy.
    Grid-Connected Devices

    A grid-connected device for electricity storage can also be classified as a DER system and is called a distributed energy storage system (DESS). DER systems can be managed and coordinated in a smart grid through an interface.
    Microgrids

    Microgrids are modern, localized, small-scale grids, as opposed to the traditional, centralized electricity grid or macrogrid. DERs can be the components of a microgrid. Think of a microgrid as a small, standalone grid, capable of meeting the energy needs of a defined area, such as a community or an area of several city blocks. To be self-sufficient in the provision of energy, a microgrid needs one or more sources of energy.

    In the past, a microgrid has included resources such as a diesel generator, but with technological advances, resources now include DERs, such as solar or wind. On a larger scale, microgrids also add efficient batteries to the mix to store energy.

    Microgrids can disconnect from the centralized grid and operate autonomously, strengthen grid resilience, and help mitigate grid disturbances. They’re typically low-voltage AC grids that use diesel generators and are installed by the community they serve. Microgrids nowadays employ a mixture of different DERs, such as solar hybrid power systems, which significantly reduce carbon emissions.
    Impact of Demand-Side Management

    Demand-side management (DSM) is a group of actions designed to efficiently manage a site’s energy consumption to cut the costs incurred for the supply of electrical energy. Costs arise from grid charges and general system charges, including taxes.

    One way utilities can meet the demand on the grid is to reduce demand from the customer side by influencing customer consumption. The energy you save is measured in negawatts. No, it's not a joke. A negawatt is a hypothetical unit of power for measuring the amount of energy saved due to efficient energy consumption. A negawatt is the cheapest electron because it’s the one you don't use.

    Utilities use conservation or energy-efficiency programs to help customers commit to using little or no energy during certain peak times, which allows the utility company to keep reserve power plants shut down. Without these programs, utilities often fire up reserve plants to meet customer demand. For instance, when all of the air conditioners switch on at the same time in a Los Angeles heat wave.

    DSM optimization aims to achieve savings in electricity charges by modifying features of electricity consumption related to the:

        Overall consumption picture
        Consumption time profile
        Contractual supply parameters, including contractual power and grid connection parameters 

    As a result of the high penetration of renewable sources and the decentralization of production sources, grid managers in many countries now see increased instability on the grid and consequent disruptions to services.
    Grid Services

    Grid managers can use generation and consumption systems that offer grid services to limit the impact of service disruptions and ensure a balance between energy consumption and the amount of power fed into the grid. To engage in demand-side management, the first requirement is to carry out an in-depth analysis of onsite consumption. This involves assessing the unique requirements of each site and whether utilities can optimize the consumption habits of customers.

    Whenever a change in habit is unfeasible or simply insufficient to achieve the desired cost reductions, utilities can evaluate these on-site installation elements.

        Battery energy storage systems (BESS)
        Renewable source systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines
        Cogeneration systems

    Time to Get Fluent in AI

    Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a dream of many storytellers and sci-fi fans for years. But for a long time most people hadn’t given AI much serious thought because it was always something that might happen far into the future. Well, researchers and computer scientists haven’t been waiting for tomorrow to arrive, they’ve been working hard to make the dream of AI into a reality. In fact, some have said we’ve already entered the Age of AI.

    The scene is in a university classroom, there’s a blackboard in the background with a sketch of a neural network. In the foreground is a college student typing on computer, drawn in the style of fun 2D vector artwork.”

    [AI-generated images using DreamStudio at stability.ai. The first uses the prompt, “A closeup of a person sitting at a typewriter, drawn in the style of fun 2D vector artwork.” The second uses the prompt, “The scene is in a university classroom, there’s a blackboard in the background with a sketch of a neural network. In the foreground is a college student typing on computer, drawn in the style of fun 2D vector artwork.”]

    It’s unclear just how deeply AI will become part of our daily lives. But what is certain is that for us to have meaningful conversations about AI, we need a shared vocabulary and a solid foundation of core concepts to build upon. As it stands, if you ask 10 people to define artificial intelligence, you’re likely to get 10 different answers. In this badge we try to reach an agreed-upon definition by exploring AI’s current capabilities. We also investigate how computer scientists create the AI systems that perform such incredible feats.

    The Difficulty of Defining AI

    The first step in defining AI is to recognize that our current notion of AI might be a little distorted. A steady diet of science fiction books and movies where AI is seen as a nefarious entity bent on conquering the world hasn’t helped.

    Science fiction isn’t the only thing that’s complicated our view of AI. Generally speaking, we humans tend to think quite highly of ourselves; the benchmark by which everything else is measured. So when we speak of artificial intelligence, we can’t help but to compare it to our own intelligence. The problem is that humans aren’t the only intelligent beings out there. Animals, from crows to octopuses, use tools and problem solving to perform complex tasks. Even slime molds can solve mazes if given enough time.

    And as we’ve begun to appreciate the huge spectrum of intelligence in the animal kingdom, we’ve also started to recognize the great diversity in our own human intelligence. Maybe you’ve met someone who’s fantastic at public speaking but can’t do math to save their life. Or someone who can always tell when you’re feeling a little anxious, but would trip over a soccer ball at the first opportunity. The point is that our intelligence is expressed in many, specialized forms. We need to think of artificial intelligence in the same way. There are specific kinds of AI that are good at specific kinds of tasks. So let’s bring some definition to what we mean by artificial intelligence by taking a close look at what AI can do today.

    Main Types of AI Capabilities

    Right now there’s no singular AI that’s good at everything. That idea, known as general AI, is still far into the future. Instead, over the years we’ve developed several specialized AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks. The kinds of tasks they do generally fall into one of a few broader categories.

    Numeric Predictions

    Have you looked at a weather forecast recently? Predicting rain or shine helps you decide if you should grab an umbrella. Although we’ve made weather predictions for thousands of years, AI can do it better than any previous method.

    A good prediction can help you answer all sorts of questions. Is this customer likely to renew their subscription? Are you at risk for a medical condition? Will there be high demand on the power grid this evening?

    Often AI predictions take the form of a value between 0 (not going to happen) to 1 (totally going to happen). Numeric predictions include more than just percent values, they can predict any numeric value, such as dollars. Maybe your business wants to predict next quarter’s sales, or figure out the optimal pricing for your latest service: Widget+. And as a consumer you’re probably already affected by these kinds of numeric predictions, even more than you realize. Just imagine a trip overseas: the airline tickets, hotel room, ridesharing, and travelers insurance are all likely to be priced by AI to perfectly balance supply and demand.

    The Trick Behind the Magic

    What AI can do may seem like magic. And like magic, it’s natural to want a peek behind the curtain to see how it’s all done. What you’ll find is that computer scientists and researchers are using lots of data, math, and processing power in place of mirrors and misdirection. Learning how AI actually works will help you use it to its fullest potential, while avoiding pitfalls due to its limitations.
    The Shift from Crafting to Training

    For decades, programmers have written code that takes an input, processes it using a set of rules, and returns an output. For example, here’s how to find the average from a set of numbers.

        Input: 5, 8, 2, 9 
        Process: Add the values [5 + 8 + 2 + 9] then divide by the number of inputs [4]
        Output: 6  

    This simple set of rules for turning an input into an output is an example of an algorithm. Algorithms have been written to perform some pretty sophisticated tasks. But some tasks have so many rules (and exceptions) that it’s impossible to capture them all in a hand-crafted algorithm. Swimming is a good example of a task that is hard to encapsulate as a set of rules. You might get some advice before jumping in the pool, but you only really figure out what works once you’re trying to keep your head above water. Some things are learned best by experience.

    What if we could train a computer in the same way? Not by tossing it into a pool, but by letting it figure out what works to succeed at a task? But just like learning to swim is very different from learning to speak a foreign language, the kind of training depends on the task. Let’s check out a few of the ways AI is trained.
    Experience Required

    Imagine that every time you went to the store to pick up milk, you tracked details of the trip in a spreadsheet. It’s a little weird, but go with it. You set up the following columns.

        Is it the weekend?
        Time of day
        Is it raining or not?
        Distance to store
        Total minutes of trip 

    After several trips you start getting a feel for how conditions affect how long it’ll take. Like, rain makes the drive longer, but it also means fewer people are shopping. Your brain makes connections between the inputs (weekend [W], time [T], raining [R], distance [D]) and the output (minutes [M]).

    Diagram of inputs [W, T, R, D

    But how can we get a computer to notice trends in the data so it can estimate too? One way is the guess-and-check method. Here’s how you do it.

    Step 1: Assign all of your inputs a “weight.” This is a number that represents how strongly an input should affect the output. It’s OK to start with the same weight for everything.

    Step 2: Use the weights with your existing data (and some clever math we won’t get into here) to estimate the minutes for a milk run. We can compare the estimate to the historic data. It’ll be way off, but that’s OK.

    Step 3: Let the computer guess a new weight for each input, making some a little more important than others. For example, the time of day might be more important than whether or not it’s raining.

    Step 4: Rerun the calculations to check if the new weights result in a better estimate. If so, it means the weights are a better fit, and changing in the right direction.

    Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4, letting the computer tweak weights until its estimates aren’t getting any better.

    At this point the computer has settled on weights for each input. If you think of weight as how strongly an input is connected to the output, you can make a diagram that uses line-thickness to represent the weight of a connection.

    Diagram of input nodes connected to an output.

    For this example it looks like the time of day has the strongest connection, but apparently rain doesn’t make much of a difference.

    This process of guess-and-check has created a model of our milk runs. And like a model boat, we can take it to the pool to see if it floats, so to speak. That means testing it in the real world. So for your next several milk runs, before you leave, have the model estimate how long it’ll take. If it’s right enough times in a row, you can confidently let it do the estimating for every future trip.

    Use the Right Data for the Right Job

    This is a very simple example of using training to make an AI model, but it touches on some important ideas. First, it’s an example of machine learning (ML), which is the process of using large amounts of data to train a model to make predictions, instead of handcrafting an algorithm.

    Second, not all data is the same. In our milk run example, the spreadsheet is what we would call structured data. It is well organized, with labels on every column so you know the significance of every cell. In contrast, unstructured data would be something like a news article, or an unlabeled image file. The kind of data that you have available will affect what kind of training you can do.

    Third, the structured data from our spreadsheet lets computers do supervised learning. It’s considered supervised because we can make sure every piece of input data has a matching, expected output that we can verify. Conversely, unstructured data is used for unsupervised learning, which is when AI tries to find connections in the data without really knowing what it’s looking for.

    Letting the computer figure out a single weight for each input is just one kind of training regimen. But often interconnected systems are more complicated than what 1-to-1 weighting can represent. Thankfully, as you learn in the next unit, there are other ways to train!

    The Need for Neural Networks

    No conversation about AI is complete without mentioning neural networks. Neural networks are important tools for training AI models, so it’s good to have some idea of what they are. But before we get into the details, let’s first discuss why we need neural networks in the first place.

    In the previous unit, you learned that we can train an AI model by letting it guess-and-check the importance-weight of each input. But the milk run example was actually overly simplified. Our model would give us pretty rough estimates. To understand why, let’s consider two scenarios.

        It’s raining on a Tuesday evening. You’d rather not get wet, so you (and many others like you) decide shopping can wait until tomorrow. In this scenario, rain is a significant factor.
        It’s raining on Saturday afternoon. For many people, this is the only time of week when they can go shopping. So the store will be busy, rain or shine. In this scenario, rain doesn’t make much difference. 

    The problem is that our original model can only assign one weight to rain, but we know it’s more complicated than that. There is a solution, though, and it starts by representing the two scenarios in two separate graphs. Again, line thickness shows importance. In the first, “weekend” and “time” are weak, while “rain” is strong. For the second, “weekend” is strong, while “time” and “rain” is weak.

    Two diagrams, each connecting “weekend,” “time,” and “rain” to separate estimates. (gray, blue, yellow)

    We know these two scenarios are significant because we’re smart and have experience buying milk. But a computer just starting to learn about milk runs doesn’t know anything yet! It has to consider many scenarios: weekend-evening-rain, weekday-morning-shine, and so forth. Instead of two graphs, eight might better represent the kinds of scenarios you encounter.

    Eight very similar graphs, each have three nodes connected to one.

    That’s a lot of very similar graphs. Since the three inputs always represent “weekend,” “time,” and “rain,” you can overlap them. If you move the outputs so they aren’t touching, you get a combined graph that looks like this.

    A graph with three nodes on one side, and eight on the other. Every node is connected with a line.

    The importance of each scenario depends on the specific inputs. But knowing the importance is only half the battle. Each scenario needs to affect the final estimate in its own way.

    For example, the weekend-afternoon-shine milk run should take much longer. So let’s give it an adjustment of +5. When we do the math to calculate an estimate, it results in a larger number. While we’re at it, let’s give the weekday-morning-rain scenario an adjustment of -4 since we know milk runs are shortest at that time.

    Each scenario gets its own adjustment, which is what we call a bias. In this case, bias is a good thing because it helps us get a more accurate estimate. Let’s redraw our graph to include the bias of each scenario.

    A graph with three nodes on one side, and eight on the other, each with its own positive or negative number. Every node is connected with a line.

    So what do we do with these eight scenarios and their biases? Using some more clever math, we can combine them into a final estimate. Some scenarios should contribute more than others, so you guessed it, we need more weights! We can update our graph to show how the scenarios connect to the final estimate with different strengths.

    A graph with three nodes on the left side, eight in the middle, and one on the right. Lines connect left to middle, and middle to right.

    This is our new model. More connections will hopefully mean better estimates. This web of connections, guided by weights and biases, is an example of a neural network. We call it that because the connections, forged by experience (data), resemble how the neurons in a brain are connected.

    And while scenario is a good beginner word for describing a unique combination of factors, we should really use the word node for that concept. It’s what AI experts use, so moving forward we’ll use it too.
    Adding Complexity to Neural Networks

    Our new milk run model is a pretty basic example of a neural network. In practice, they can get quite complex. Let’s explore some of the ways researchers set up neural networks to get better results for specific tasks.

    First, you might be wondering why we chose eight nodes to stand between our inputs and output. There’s actually some flexibility in that number. We know that having no nodes at all will give us rough estimates. In the same way, having too few might not capture all of the nuance of the system we’re trying to model. But having too many nodes is a problem, too. We don’t want to make the computer do more calculations than necessary. So there’s a sweet spot for the number of nodes where we get good results for the least effort. Choosing the right number is part of designing a good neural network.

    There’s something else we can do to make artificial neural networks more like our own, organic ones. It has to do with how our minds often leap from idea to idea to find connections between two things that are not obviously related. Some of the most brilliant insights are the result of several leaps. So, what if we could make a neural network that could make more leaps, too? We can! We do it by adding more nodes as layers, connecting each node to its neighbor.

    Diagram of a neural network with two layers of nodes between inputs and outputs.

    Training AI by adding extra layers to find hidden meaning in data is what’s called deep learning. Thanks to an abundance of computing power, many neural networks are designed to have multiple layers. Again, the best number of layers is a balance between the number of calculations required and the quality of results they produce.
    More Than Mental Math, It’s Neural Network Math

    So, about those calculations. Up to this point we’ve glossed over the math part of training neural networks. That’s for a few reasons. First, the math can get really complicated, really fast. For example, here’s a snippet of a research paper about neural networks.

    Screenshot of a highly technical research paper about neural networks

    Yeah, it’s intense!

    Second, the exact math is going to depend on what kind of task you’re training the neural network to do. Third, each new research paper updates the math as we learn what works better at training different models.

    So, designing a neural network involves choosing the number of nodes, layers, and the appropriate math for the task it’s training for. With the model architecture ready, you have to let the computer use all that fancy math to do its guess-and-check routine. Eventually it’ll figure out the best weights and biases to give good estimates.

    And this brings us to something that’s a little unsettling about artificial neural networks. Imagine a skilled talent scout who’s looking for the next great baseball player. “I’ll know him when I see him,” they might say. They can’t explain how they’ll know, they just will. In the same way, our neural network can’t explain why certain factors are important. Sure, we can look at the values attached to each weight and bias, but the relevance of a number that’s the result of a connection of a connection of a connection will be lost to us.

    So just like how the mind of the talent scout is a black box, so is our neural network. Because we don’t observe the layers between the input and output, they’re referred to as hidden layers.
    Wrap Up

    To summarize, neural networks are a mix of nodes, layers, weights, biases, and a bunch of math. Together they mimic our own organic neural networks. Each neural network is carefully tuned for a specific task. Maybe it’s great at predicting rain, maybe it categorizes plants, or maybe it keeps your car centered in the lane on the highway. Whatever the task, neural networks are a big part of what makes AI seem magical. And now you know a little bit about how the trick is done.

    Classifications

    Is a hot dog a sandwich? This question has led to countless hours of friendly philosophical debate about how we categorize things. But in the real world, the stakes can be much higher. Is this plant edible or poisonous? Is that email legitimate or a phishing attempt? Classification is often the first step in taking some kind of action, making it an incredibly valuable skill.

    So it isn’t surprising that computer scientists have worked hard to create AI that’s good at classifying data. Identifying plants and phishing emails is only the tip of the iceberg. Financial institutions need to flag fraudulent transactions. Medical professionals must diagnose illnesses. Social media platforms want to identify toxic comments. All of these are examples of classification problems. AI can effectively make the first pass at classifying, and then the professionals can take it from there.

    Often, AI classifiers can do the job just as well, or better, than humans. That said, each classifier is only good at one, narrow task. So the AI that’s great at detecting phishing emails would be lousy at identifying pictures of actual fish.

    Robotic Navigation

    Some AIs excel at navigating a changing environment, and that might mean actual navigation in the case of autonomous (hands-free) driving. AI-powered cars are already quite capable of keeping centered in a lane and following at a safe distance on the highway. They adapt to curves in the road, gusts of wind from semi trucks, and sudden stops due to traffic.

    AI that can adapt to changing environmental conditions have all sorts of real-world applications. For example, businesses need to produce and deliver products to their customers every day. Lots of market conditions play a role in how quickly that gets done: materials availability, manufacturing capacity, existing inventory, transportation costs, even real-time traffic. AI can optimize the supply chain even while conditions are changing.

    And let’s not forget robots! Even the modest robot floor sweeper can avoid stairs and chairs. On a bigger scale, assembly lines are being fitted with robots that become faster and more efficient over time. Those same robots can adjust for changes to the production method without costly reprogramming. And researchers are creating rescue robots that can traverse disaster areas, such as a collapsed building. A robot-caterpillar that can squeeze through tiny cracks could deliver aid and hope to those trapped inside.

    Language Processing

    On November 30, 2022, Merriam-Webster’s word of the day was quiddity. Those who learned that word got a little better at what might be the most important skill of all: communication. On that same day, the world was introduced to ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence that demonstrated its own communication skills. It could write long responses to questions about almost any topic. And the responses seemed like they were written by a human. ChatGPT is one of the most capable AIs built to interpret everyday language and act on it in some meaningful way. This is known in the industry as natural language processing, or just NLP.

    Natural language processing relies on an understanding of how words are used together, and that lets AI extract the intention behind the words. For example, you might want to translate a document from English to German. Or maybe you want a short summary of a long, scientific paper. AI can do that too.

    NLP is a huge part of generative AI, a subcategory of AI that takes words and turns them into unique images, sounds, and of course other words. Generative AI is such a disruptive technology that we’ve devoted a whole badge to Generative AI Basics. Check it out when you’re done here.

    In Summary

    Artificial intelligence can be thought of as the ability for a computer to perform skills typically associated with human intuition, inference, and reasoning. At this time, AI skills are very specialized, and fall into some broad categories like numeric predictions and language processing.

    Now that you have a sense of what AI is (and isn’t), you’re ready to explore how computer scientists and researchers create AI.

    What’s Automation for Service?

    Customer service is about providing a smooth and simple journey that meets each customer’s needs. It often takes many steps, agents, and systems to complete that journey. Automation helps to streamline the process. 

    For example, what if you could automate a repetitive task, like entering customer details only once and having them show up wherever they’re needed across the company? This process saves time for the customer and service team while ensuring accuracy. Likewise, automating complex processes across your entire business ensures that your team has the tools they need when customers are sent to the next stage in their journey.

    Here’s a quick video overview of the service experience. While you watch it, think about how this service journey is automated and ways you could adapt it to your business.

    What Is Natural Language Processing?

    Natural language processing (NLP), is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that combines computer science and linguistics to give computers the ability to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that’s meaningful and useful to humans.

    NLP helps computers perform useful tasks like understanding the meaning of sentences, recognizing important details in text, translating languages, answering questions, summarizing text, and generating responses that resemble human responses.

    NLP is already so commonplace in our everyday lives that we usually don’t even think about it when we interact with it or when it does something for us. For example, maybe your email or document creation app automatically suggests a word or phrase you could use next. You may ask a virtual assistant, like Siri, to remind you to water your plants on Tuesdays. Or you might ask Alexa to tell you details about the last big earthquake in Chile for your daughter’s science project.

    The chatbots you engage with when you contact a company’s customer service use NLP, and so does the translation app you use to help you order a meal in a different country. Spam detection, your online news preferences, and so much more rely on NLP.
    A Very Brief History of NLP

    It’s worth mentioning that NLP is not new. In fact, its roots wind back to the 1950s when researchers began using computers to understand and generate human language. One of the first notable contributions to NLP was the Turing Test. Developed by Alan Turing, this test measures a machine’s ability to answer any question in a way that’s indistinguishable from a human. Shortly after that, the first machine translation systems were developed. These were sentence- and phrase-based language translation experiments that didn’t progress very far because they relied on very specific patterns of language, like predefined phrases or sentences.

    A 1950s mainframe-style computer being operated by a computer scientist.

    By the 1960s, researchers were experimenting with rule-based systems that allowed users to ask the computer to complete tasks or have conversations.

    The 1970s and 80s saw more sophisticated knowledge-based approaches using linguistic rules, rule-based reasoning, and domain knowledge for tasks like executing commands and diagnosing medical conditions.

    Statistical approaches (i.e., learning from data) to NLP were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, leading to advances in speech recognition, machine translation, and machine algorithms. During this period, the introduction of the World Wide Web in 1993 made vast amounts of text-based data readily available for NLP research.

    A stack of papers and books.

    Since about 2009, neural networks and deep learning have dominated NLP research and development. NLP areas of translation and natural language generation, including the recently introduced ChatGPT, have vastly improved and continue to evolve rapidly.

    Human Language Is “Natural” Language

    What is natural language anyway? Natural language refers to the way humans communicate with each other using words and sentences. It’s the language we use in conversations, when we read, write, or listen. Natural language is the way we convey information, express ideas, ask questions, tell stories, and engage with each other. While NLP models are being developed for many different human languages, this module focuses on NLP in the English language.

    If you completed the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals badge, you learned about unstructured data and structured data. These are important terms in NLP, too. Natural language–the way we actually speak–is unstructured data, meaning that while we humans can usually derive meaning from it, it doesn’t provide a computer with the right kind of detail to make sense of it. The following paragraph about an adoptable shelter dog is an example of unstructured data.

    Tala is a 5-year-old spayed, 65-pound female husky who loves to play in the park and take long hikes. She is very gentle with young children and is great with cats. This blue-eyed sweetheart has a long gray and white coat that will need regular brushing. You can schedule a time to meet Tala by calling the Troutdale shelter.

    For a computer to understand what we mean, this information needs to be well-defined and organized, similar to what you might find in a spreadsheet or a database. This is called structured data. The information included in structured data and how the data is formatted is ultimately determined by algorithms used by the desired end application. For example, data for a translation app is structured differently than data for a chatbot. Here’s how the data in the paragraph above might look as structured data for an app that can help match dogs with potential adopters.

        Name: Tala
        Age: 5
        Spayed or Neutered: Spayed
        Sex: Female
        Breed: Husky
        Weight: 65 lbs.
        Color: Gray and white
        Eye color: Blue
        Good with children: Yes
        Good with cats: Yes
        Favorite activities: Parks, hikes
        Location: Troutdale 

    Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation

    Today’s NLP matured with its two subfields, natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). Data processed from unstructured to structured is called natural language understanding (NLU). NLU uses many techniques to interpret written or spoken language to understand the meaning and context behind it. You learn about these techniques in the next unit.

    Data processed the reverse way–from structured to unstructured–is called natural language generation (NLG). NLG is what enables computers to generate human-like language. NLG involves the development of algorithms and models that convert structured data or information into meaningful, contextually appropriate, natural-like text or speech. It also includes the generation of code in a programming language, such as generating a Python function for sorting strings.

    In the past, NLU and NLG tasks made use of explicit linguistic structured representations like parse trees. While NLU and NLG are still critical to NLP today, most of the apps, tools, and virtual assistants we communicate with have evolved to use deep learning or neural networks to perform tasks from end-to-end. For instance, a neural machine translation system may translate a sentence from, say, Chinese, directly into English without explicitly creating any kind of intermediate structure. Neural networks recognize patterns, words, and phrases to make language processing exponentially faster and more contextually accurate.

    In the next unit, you learn more about our natural language methods and techniques that enable computers to make sense of what we say and respond accordingly.

    Learn About Natural Language Parsing
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Discuss the basic elements of natural language.
        Describe several important techniques used when parsing natural language.
        Explain how sentiment, intent, and context analysis contribute to NLP. 

    Basic Elements of Natural Language

    Understanding and processing natural language is a fundamental challenge for computers. That's because it involves not only recognizing individual words, but also comprehending their relationships, their context, and their meaning.

    Our natural language, in text and speech, is characterized by endless complexity, nuances, ambiguity, and mistakes. In our everyday communication, we encounter words with several meanings; words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings; misplaced modifiers; misspellings; and mispronunciations. We also encounter people who speak fast, mumble, or who take forever to get to the point; and people who use speech patterns in accents or dialects that are different from ours.

    Take this sentence for example:

    “We saw six bison on vacation in Yellowstone National Park.”

    You might giggle a little as you imagine six bison in hats and sunglasses posing for selfies in front of Old Faithful. But, most likely, you understand what actually happened–that is, that someone who was on vacation in Yellowstone National Park saw six bison.

    Or this:

    “They swam out to the buoy.”

    If you heard someone speak this sentence without any context, you may think the people involved swam out to a male child, when in fact, they swam out to a marker in the water. The pronunciation of “boy” and “buoy” is slightly different, but the enunciation is not always made clear.

    While humans are able to flex and adapt to language fairly easily, training a computer to consider these kinds of nuances is quite difficult.

    Elements of natural language in English include:

        Vocabulary: The words we use
        Grammar: The rules governing sentence structure
        Syntax: How words are combined to form sentences according to grammar
        Semantics: The meaning of words, phrases, and sentences
        Pragmatics: The context and intent behind cultural or geographic language use
        Discourse and dialogue: Units larger than a single phrase or sentence, including documents and conversations
        Phonetics and phonology: The sounds we make when we communicate
        Morphology: How parts of words can be combined or uncombined to make new words 

    Parsing Natural Language

    Teaching a computer to read and derive meaning from words is a bit like teaching a child to read–they both learn to recognize words, their sounds, meaning, and pronunciation. But when a child learns to read, they usually have the advantage of context from a story; visual cues from illustrations; and relationships to things they already know, like trees or animals. They also often get assistance and encouragement from experienced readers, who help explain what they’re learning. These cues help new readers identify and attach meaning to words and phrases that they can generalize to other things they read in the future.

    Natural Language Processing robot pointing to symbols of tasks it can process: lists, information, customer service, spam detection.

    We know that computers are a different kind of smart, so while a computer needs to understand the elements of natural language described above, the approach needs to be much more scientific. NLP uses algorithms and methods like large language models (LLMs), statistical models, machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based systems to process and analyze text. These techniques, called parsing, involve breaking down text or speech into smaller parts to classify them for NLP. Parsing includes syntactic parsing, where elements of natural language are analyzed to identify the underlying grammatical structure, and semantic parsing which derives meaning.

    As mentioned in the last unit, natural language is parsed in different ways to match intended outcomes. For example, natural language that’s parsed for a translation app uses different algorithms or models and is parsed differently than natural language intended for a virtual assistant like Alexa.

    Syntactic parsing may include:

        Segmentation: Larger texts are divided into smaller, meaningful chunks. Segmentation usually occurs at the end of sentences at punctuation marks to help organize text for further analysis.
        Tokenization: Sentences are split into individual words, called tokens. In the English language, tokenization is a fairly straightforward task because words are usually broken up by spaces. In languages like Thai or Chinese, tokenization is much more complicated and relies heavily on an understanding of vocabulary and morphology to accurately tokenize language.
        Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form, or stem. For example breaking, breaks, or unbreakable are all reduced to break. Stemming helps to reduce the variations of word forms, but, depending on context, it may not lead to the most accurate stem. Look at these two examples that use stemming: 

    “I’m going outside to rake leaves.”

    Stem = leave 

    “He always leaves the key in the lock.”

    Stem = leave 

        Lemmatization: Similar to stemming, lemmatization reduces words to their root, but takes the part of speech into account to arrive at a much more valid root word, or lemma. Here are the same two examples using lemmatization: 

    “I’m going outside to rake leaves.”

    Lemma = leaf 

    “He always leaves the key in the lock.”

    Lemma = leave 

        Part of speech tagging: Assigns grammatical labels or tags to each word based on its part of speech, such as a noun, adjective, verb, and so on. Part of speech tagging is an important function in NLP because it helps computers understand the syntax of a sentence.
        Named entity recognition (NER): Uses algorithms to identify and classify named entities–like people, dates, places, organizations, and so on–in text to help with tasks like answering questions and information extraction. 

    Semantic Analysis

    Parsing natural language using some or all of the steps we just described does a pretty good job of capturing the meaning of text or speech. But it lacks soft skill nuances that make human language, well, human. Semantic parsing involves analyzing the grammatical format of sentences and relationships between words and phrases to find the meaning representation. Extracting how people feel, why they are engaging, and details about circumstances surrounding an interaction all play a crucial role in accurately deciphering text or speech and forming an appropriate response.

    Here are several common analysis techniques that are used in NLP. Each of these techniques can be powered by a number of different algorithms to get the desired level of understanding depending on the specific task and the complexity of the analysis.

    Sentiment analysis: Involves determining whether a piece of text (such as a sentence, a social media post, a review, or a tweet) expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. A sentiment is a feeling or an attitude toward something. For example, sentiment analysis can determine if this customer review of a service is positive or negative: "I had to wait a very long time for my haircut.” Sentiment helps identify and classify emotions or opinions in text to help businesses understand how people feel about their products, services, or experiences.

    A happy-looking woman with a speech bubble that says, “This is my favorite pizza, ever!” and a grumpy-looking man with a speech bubble that says, “I’m still waiting for my haircut.”

    Intent analysis: Intent helps us understand what someone wants or means based on what they say or write. It’s like deciphering the purpose or intention behind their words. For example, if someone types, “I can’t log in to my account,” into a customer support chatbot, intent analysis would recognize that the person’s intent is to get help to access their account. The chatbot might reply with details about resetting a password or other means the user can try to access their account. Virtual assistants, customer support systems, or chatbots often use intent analysis to understand user requests and provide appropriate responses or actions.

    Context (discourse) analysis: Natural language relies heavily on context. The interpretation of a statement might change based on the situation, the details provided, and any shared understanding that exists between the people communicating. Context analysis involves understanding this surrounding information to make sense of a piece of text. For example, if someone says, “They had a ball,” context analysis can determine if they are talking about a fancy dance party, a piece of sports equipment, or a whole lot of fun. It does this by considering the previous conversation or the topic being discussed. Context analysis helps NLP systems interpret words more accurately by taking into account the broader context, the relationships between words, and other relevant information.

    These three analysis techniques–sentiment analysis, intent analysis, and context analysis–play important roles in extracting valuable insights from text and speech data. They create a more sophisticated and accurate understanding and engagement with textual content in various applications of NLP.
    Summary

    In this module, you’ve learned about NLP at a very high level, and as it relates to the English language. To-date, the majority of NLP study is conducted using English, but you can also find a great deal of research done in Spanish, French, Farsi, Urdu, Chinese, and Arabic. NLP is a very rapidly evolving field of AI. And advancements in NLP are quickly leading to more sophisticated language understanding, cross-language capabilities, and integration with other AI fields.

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Understand what machine learning can do for your CRM data.
        Identify ways to use machine learning predictions.

    Unlock the Power of Your Data 

    Today, trillions of gigabytes of data exist. And as a company in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), the data you possess can predict future outcomes and drive decision-making. But according to the Salesforce Untapped Data Research, most companies aren’t harnessing the power of their data’s potential even though four out of five (80%) business leaders say data is critical to decision-making. 

    Using a type of AI called machine learning (ML), you can transform historical data into predictive insights. This is known as predictive AI, which is different from generative AI. 

        Predictive AI informs, using existing data to discover something new about the data. For example, predictive AI estimates the likelihood of attrition or fraud.
        Generative AI assists, using existing data to create new data similar to what already exists. For example, generative AI creates new text and images.

    To learn more about predictive vs generative AI, check out the Discover AI Techniques and Applications unit in Data Fundamentals for AI. 
    Inject Machine Learning into Your Business

    Predictive insights from machine learning enable business users to make better decisions, faster. Use predictive AI from machine learning to drive innovation, efficiency, and strategic decision-making across your organization. Here are some of the top use cases for predictive insights (but there are plenty more).

    Benefit from Machine Learning, No Data Science Experience Required

    You don’t need to be a data scientist to leverage machine learning. While data scientists are often involved in training and refining ML models, the insights from the model are meant for the business users. According to the Harvard Business Review, data scientists struggle to communicate the value of ML insights and cite “results not used by decision makers” as one of the top challenges. 

    Adding ML to Salesforce bridges the gap between data scientists and the business. In Salesforce, users can make decisions and take actions on the ML insights, without having to read a data science report.

    You can transform historical data into meaningful insights for your organization using Einstein.

        Einstein Studio: Use the ML-powered insights in Data Cloud with Connected Models data science teams already built by connecting to it and bringing the model’s insights into Salesforce. You can leave the model where it is (like AWS SageMaker), and leverage its ML-powered insights within Salesforce.
        Einstein Discovery: Build your own ML model from the ground up in CRM Analytics, with Einstein’s guidance. Rely on Einstein to walk you through building, training, evaluating, and activating an ML model in Data Cloud.

    Now you understand what machine learning can do for your data, and can identify ways your organization can benefit from ML-powered predictions.

        Explain what Google Analytics 360 is.
        Outline the values of the integration with Salesforce Sales Cloud.
        List the integration requirements to get started.

    Note

    This module was produced in collaboration with Google, which owns, supports, and maintains the Google products, services, and features described here. Use of Google products, services, and features is governed by privacy policies and service agreements maintained by Google.

    Note

    Universal Analytics 360 and the data sources it uses, universal properties (UA), are being sunset. Trailhead shall maintain these modules to support Trailblazers who continue to use these services until such time. We are hard at work developing content that supports the new Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration.
    Online and Offline, Sales and Marketing, Connecting the Dots

    With customer touch points occurring across so many sources, it can be hard for marketing and sales teams to create a complete, accurate view of the customer story. It’s even harder when a large portion of the sales process occurs offline. Like chapters in a book, you need to have them all together for everything to make sense. 

    When you have a complete view of the customer, you can understand how effective your marketing has been in delivering sales. You can improve the performance of your digital marketing by optimizing your bids or by focusing on the most valuable audiences. Sales teams can get even more targeted and relevant support to help them progress and close deals.

    The sales funnel has a combination of online interactions, such as site browsing, and offline interactions, such as marketing and sales qualification.
    What is Google Marketing Platform and what is Analytics 360?

    Google Marketing Platform is a unified advertising and analytics platform that helps enterprise marketers make better decisions faster. With Google Marketing Platform, you’re in control of your marketing, so you have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of your business and your customers. 

    Google Analytics 360*, part of Google Marketing Platform, gives you the tools you need to better understand your customers. Use the insights you learn to take action, such as improving your website, creating tailored audience lists, and more. In addition to the features available in Google Analytics, Analytics 360 provides additional capabilities:

        Advanced Analysis
        Unsampled reports
        Google BigQuery export
        Data-driven attribution
        Native integrations with Google Marketing Platform
        Integrations with Salesforce

    *There is an annual license fee for Analytics 360 and Salesforce is an authorized reseller.
    How Salesforce and Google Put It All Together

    With the Sales Cloud and Google Analytics 360 integration, you can link your accounts and import your Sales Cloud data directly into Analytics 360 and get a more complete view of the entire customer story, whether it happens online, offline, or both. This will help you better optimize your digital marketing and bring more customers to your sales teams.

    This integration is designed to save time, get more valuable insights, help you optimize your media, and customize your marketing experiences for specific audiences. 

    Save Time. Combining all of these offline and online insights used to be a time-consuming process involving multiple spreadsheets and disparate data. This integration helps you cut down on the wait time from importing offline conversion data and helps you stitch together these insights automatically, updating as often as hourly.

    Get More Insights. With Sales Cloud data in Analytics 360, you can see offline sales data alongside your site analytics and media data. For example, is organic search driving more phone sales compared to paid search? With your offline sales data from Salesforce Sales Cloud in Analytics 360, you now have the insights to help you answer this question, and many more.

    Optimized Media for Better ROI. Optimize paid media based on offline sales activity. For example, once you’ve created Goals in Analytics 360 based on your Sales Cloud events, you can automatically optimize your search or display campaigns for actual sales that occur offline, instead of optimizing for form submissions on your site. This will likely lead to improved ROI as you spend your digital media budgets on more valuable outcomes.

    Intelligently Build Audiences. With Sales Cloud data in Analytics 360, you will be able to more intelligently build audiences based on the intersection of online and offline data. For instance, you can create audiences in Analytics 360 made up of qualified leads from Sales Cloud. You can then reach those customers with more relevant ads, including search ads, display ads, and video ads.
    Two Things You Need to Know

    There are two key requirements you should keep in mind if you are interested in using this integration.

        You must be a licensee of both Salesforce Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 in order to use this integration. This integration is only available to customers who have purchased Analytics 360.
        The integration supports sharing data from Sales Cloud Objects Leads and Opportunities. The Leads and Opportunities shared with Analytics 360 must have originated from an Analytics 360-tagged site for the integration to work, and the lead can be created either via an online lead form (native integration) or via a phone call (custom solution adding a call tracking solution).

    Note

    If your organization uses Custom Objects, you may have to use an alternative setup depending on how those Custom Objects are deployed. Please refer to Unit 3: Dive Into Some Use Cases and Examples and corresponding resources, or consult with your service provider for more details.

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Identify the key roles involved in integrating Sales Cloud and Analytics 360.
        List the technical and administrative steps needed to complete the integration.

    In this unit, we review the technical steps required to integrate Sales Cloud and Analytics 360. The good news is that linking your Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 accounts is easy!
    What’s Required?

    You will need login and administrative access to both Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud, as you’ll need to both configure Sales Cloud to collect certain data and then Analytics 360 to map to and receive that data.

    Three people standing in a meeting room discussing integration.
    Key Roles

    While stakeholders may vary depending on company size and organization, there are typically 3 key roles needed to ensure a successful integration of Sales Cloud and Analytics 360:

        Analytics Lead and/or Admin. An Analytics 360 Administrator is necessary to create a new data import from Sales Cloud and set up the new events within Analytics 360. This requires proper credentials within Analytics 360.
        CRM Lead and/or Admin. A Salesforce Administrator will need to set up the link with Analytics 360 and create the fields in Sales Cloud to store key data—Analytics Client ID (GACLID) and Google Analytics Tracking ID—in the Lead and Opportunity objects.
        Web Development Lead. A web developer is necessary to modify the lead collection form on your website and add the GACLID to the parameters passed to Sales Cloud upon lead submission.

    The size and complexity of your implementation will influence who is on the integration team. How your company is organized will also influence who is on the integration team. When you are organizing your team and considering who your stakeholders are, keep in mind, one of the main goals is to allow the marketing team and the sales team to work better together.
    Permissions

    The user performing the linking must be an Admin (have Edit permissions) for the Analytics 360 implementation. The Analytics 360 Sales Cloud Data Import requires access to several Salesforce fields, organized by object. A Sales Cloud user with System Administrator access likely has access to all necessary fields.
    Create Custom Fields in Sales Cloud

    Create three new custom fields where you will store the Google Analytics IDs in Sales Cloud. You can name these fields however you’d like. The names below provide examples. Once created, you select and map these fields at the Data Import configuration setup stage.

        Client ID: one with the Field Name, e.g., GACLIENTID
        User ID: (optional) another with the Field Name, e.g., GAUSERID
        Tracking ID: another one with the Field Name, e.g., GATRACKID 

    These custom fields need to be created on both Lead and Opportunity objects and mapped between the 2 objects so that once a lead is converted into an opportunity, these fields are copied over. Also, you should ensure that status and stages have history tracking on.
    Adjust Your Lead Form

    Adjust your lead form to pass the required information into Sales Cloud. 

        Add ClientID as well as User ID (optional) into your lead form as new hidden input field(s).
        Add Tracking ID in your lead form as a new hidden input field with the value matching the Tracking ID for your site.

    Link Analytics 360 to Your Sales Cloud Account

    In this step, you'll link Analytics to your Salesforce Sales Cloud account by creating a new Data Import data set, and then by authorizing access to your Sales Cloud account.

        First, log in to your Google Analytics 360 account and navigate to Admin > Property, then click Data Import to Create a new Data Import Schema.
        Select the Salesforce type under CRM Data to import data about offline conversions from Sales Cloud.
        Name and save your Data Set. For example, Salesforce Offline Conversions.
        Create a new Sales Cloud authorization by naming the Credentials set to reuse later (for example, GA-SC) and click Access Salesforce.com to log in to your Sales Cloud account in the pop-up and complete the linking. The pop-up will automatically close upon successful login authentication and the linking will be completed.

    The Create Data Set screen with CRM Data section and the Continue button highlighted by a red box.
    Select the Milestones to Import

    In this step, you'll select the Salesforce lead and opportunity milestones to import. You'll also choose how often to import them.

        Select the Lead and/or Opportunity milestone(s) that you want to import as Events from your Sales Cloud account to Analytics 360. For example:
            Lead: Contacted
            Lead: Qualified
            Opportunity: Open / Proposal
            Opportunity: Closed / Won
            Opportunity: Closed / Lost
        You also have the option to import attribute and product data. Attribute data import allows you to import user attributes from custom fields and selected standard fields from your Salesforce Lead and Opportunity objects. This includes:
            Industry
            NumberOfEmployees
            Rating
            ScoreIntelligenceId

    This step is highly recommended, as these attributes enable a wide variety of new audience targeting and analysis use cases.
    Set Import Frequency and Verify Setup

    You’re almost there! In this final step, you’ll first have the opportunity to define the frequency of data import—hourly is recommended. 

        In the Analytics 360 UI, navigate to Admin > Property > Data Import and click Manage Uploads.
        In the Uploads for Salesforce Offline Conversions page, click More, then Fetch Now. This will attempt to upload your Sales Cloud data to Analytics. If the upload is successful, the Status column will show Completed. If an error occurs, the Status column shows Failed with a link to display more details.

    Dive Into Some Use Cases and Examples
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe several use cases for the Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 integration.
        Understand how data from Sales Cloud and Google Marketing Platform in Google Cloud can be used for advanced marketers.

    Now that you’ve learned the basics about the Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 integration, let’s dive deeper into use cases and examples of how our platforms can work together to empower your sales and marketing teams to work better together.
    Visualize the Full Sales Funnel from Online to Offline

    Use Online Events from Analytics 360 and Offline Events Imported from Sales Cloud 

    One of the simplest but most effective ways to get value from this integration is to explore your offline Sales Cloud data directly in Analytics 360.

        First, ensure that you are tracking the relevant steps of the online funnel with events. For example, if you want to look at the funnel of users who visited your product page then submitted a lead and finally converted, you should set up an event in Analytics 360 for when a user visits your product page.
        From there, create a custom report that looks at each of those events, the online events measured by Analytics 360 (e.g., the product page visit and the lead form submission) and the offline events imported from Sales Cloud (e.g., lead and opportunity milestones). Then analyze your full online to offline funnel to understand the performance of your different marketing channels.

    Use Custom Funnels and Build Targeted Audiences

    Using the Custom Funnels feature in Analytics 360, you can visualize the steps your users are taking to complete a purchase on your website and take action where there is drop off. Now with your Sales Cloud data integrated into Analytics 360, you can use Custom Funnels to see how successful your business is at turning online leads measured in Analytics 360 into offline sales measured in Sales Cloud.

    Imagine you are a solar panel company, and your website has a lead form potential customers can use to get in touch with a member of your sales team. Now, you can use Custom Funnels to visualize what percentage of leads submitted online were converted to in-person consult, and then which of those went on to purchase the solar panels. These visual reports help you identify drop-off points so that you can fine-tune the customer experience and improve marketing performance.

    The Solar Panel Sales Performance dashboard in Google Analytics 360 showing 101 qualified sales opportunities and a call to action based on the data.

        To take immediate action from Custom Funnels, you can simply click Create new segment to build an audience of people who have dropped off from a particular stage. Once you have that audience segment built, you can use it for media targeting, site personalization, or qualitative research. For example, you could build a segment of customers who have filled out the online lead form but have not scheduled a call with a sales agent. You could use digital ads or custom site messaging to encourage this group to follow up. You learn more about this in the sections below.
        Then, with advanced attribution tools in Analytics 360, such as Data-driven Attribution, you can create more accurate cross-channel attribution models so you can better understand what channels drive offline sales. For example, after you apply a data-driven statistical model, you may uncover that paid search and email drives more offline solar panel installations than social. You can use this information to adjust your investment for paid search and email—improving your return on ad spend (ROAS) in the process.

    Optimize Your Marketing Investment to Offline Goals

    Going one step further, you can also create Goals in Analytics 360 based on your Sales Cloud events and optimize your digital marketing campaigns for sales that occur offline, instead of just optimizing for form submissions on your site. 

    How? Simply share these goals (triggered by offline events imported from Sales Cloud) to Google Ads and Search Ads 360, then adapt your search bidding strategy to account for these goals.

    Note

    For the solar company optimizing media for installations scheduled over the phone, this could mean paying more for keywords that drive those successful phone calls, and paying less for keywords which drive unqualified leads that do not convert to consultations or to eventual sales.
    Intelligently Build Audiences with Sales Cloud Data

    In addition to more insightful reporting and smarter media optimization from offline data, the connection between Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud gives you even more audience attributes to work with, helping you improve the specificity of your audiences.

    For example, if you’re an insurance company that generates leads online but sells policies in person via an agent, you could build an audience in Analytics 360 of all customers who have purchased an auto insurance policy offline. You could use that audience to either deliver relevant display ads (like new insurance products shown to those who browsed that page online) using Display & Video 360, or customize your website (like a customer service showcase) using Optimize 360.

    Note

    Optimize 360, part of Google Marketing Platform, allows you to create different variations of your website and deliver a personalized experience that works for each customer. Powered by the native integration with Analytics 360, you can use Optimize 360 to conduct site testing and personalization on the insights you’ve gained from the Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud integration.

    Einstein lead score card indicating a positive score of 96.

    You can even use Einstein Lead Scoring to build these audiences in the above use cases. For example, the solar company could build an Analytics 360 audience of users who filled out a lead form online and then were assigned an Einstein Lead Score of 80 or higher. Then, they can share that audience with Optimize 360 to ensure those qualified users have a unique site experience or to Display & Video 360 to deliver more relevant ads to keep them engaged.
    Learn How You Can Delight Your Customers Even More

    Once you have built valuable audiences using Sales Cloud and Analytics 360, there are even more opportunities to learn about them and help you discover new, similar customers.

        Similar Audiences. Similar Audiences is a powerful—but simple—way to reach a much larger audience and drive sales by algorithmically expanding the reach of your existing audiences. For example, you can import into Analytics 360 an audience of highly qualified leads from Sales Cloud, then send that list to Display & Video 360 to build a similar audience that looks like your prospects. You can show tailored ads to this list to try to grow new business.
        Surveys. Google Surveys 360 gives you the ability to ask questions directly to your audiences, allowing you to learn more qualitative information from your users after you’ve engaged with them. For instance, you could ask your customers how they feel about your brand or your category, helping you to learn valuable and first-hand insights.
        Google Cloud for deeper analysis. The integration between Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 also allows users to take advantage of Google Cloud. All your Analytics 360 data, including your imported Sales Cloud data, can be sent directly to Google Cloud’s BigQuery—a fast, highly scalable, cost-effective, and fully managed cloud data warehouse for analytics, with built-in machine learning. Learn more.

    As you can see, by using the full capabilities of Salesforce Sales Cloud, Analytics 360 and Google Marketing Platform, you can deliver exceptional experiences for your customers and grow your business.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List the steps for creating a career plan.
        Identify your unique strengths, skills, and talents and what’s important to you.
        Describe the different elements of self-assessment. 

    A Quick Introduction to Career Development

    Whether you’re just starting out in your career or already have a few years of experience under your belt, it can be helpful to step back and think about your career plan. Career planning is not a one-time event; it’s an ongoing process to revisit throughout your career as your priorities and interests shift and change.

    Career development is like a jungle gym.

    Picture career development as a jungle gym to explore, not a ladder to climb. There are various directions you can explore: up, down, and sideways. When you’re clear about your career goals, you can choose the options that are the best fit. Then it’s time to get ready for new experiences or new roles.

    The career development process can be helpful to revisit when you’re thinking about switching careers or applying your existing experience to work in a new field. Or maybe you’re returning to work after a period out of the workforce.
    Developing a career plan involves three main steps or phases.

    Discover. Plan. Act.

    You can use these three simple steps to plan your career.

        Discover. Get to know yourself, including your motivations, experiences you want, skills to build, and career goals to achieve. Research and explore opportunities and career paths that interest you and that may not have considered before.
        Plan. Identify a goal and any skills you need to build or to reach that goal. Lay out a plan of how you will achieve that goal.
        Act.Take action on your plan. Identify how to get connected to employers and mentors that can help you. Prepare your resume and social media presence to land that dream job. 

    Get to Know Yourself

    The first step in managing your career is to get a clear picture of who you are and what you want.

    This includes:

        Knowing what motivates you and what matters in your life
        Identifying your strengths and opportunities to improve
        Finding out what you’re most interested in 

    What we want can change over time—our priorities change, we can discover new interests or skills that we want to develop and learn. This is an opportunity to check in and see where you are today.

    I know myself and what I want.

    There are many free self-assessment tools out there to help you identify your own values, skills, and interests. We’ve provided links to a few of them in the resources section. You may want to start by exploring some of these tools.

    We’ve also provided a Career Exploration Resources pack with worksheets to guide you through each step of the career development process. We recommend downloading it and finding a quiet place where you can work through it.
    What Motivates You

    Think about that day you left work or school thinking “Wow, that was a great day!”

    Do you remember what was happening? Whatever it was, you were probably doing something that you found motivating and energizing.

    Get to know what motivates you.

    What you find motivating is unique to you and it’s the starting point in getting to know yourself.

    Examples of motivators include:

        Creativity and innovation
        Problem-solving
        Being an expert 

    Curious about what motivates you? Complete the Values and Skills Assessment worksheet in the Career Exploration Resources pack you downloaded to identify your top 5.
    Next Steps

    Once you’ve completed your self-assessment, review your results and identify any themes that emerge. It can be helpful to talk over your results with a friend or family member.

    Next we explore career options and see how they align with the themes you’ve identified.

    Explore Career Options
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe the different job roles within the Salesforce ecosystem.
        Research potential career options that align to your interests.
        Identify skills and requirements for your target career goal. 

    Researching Career Pathways

    Now that you’ve looked inward to assess your current skills, interests, and values, it’s time to expand your view outward and explore different pathways that interest you.

    Perhaps you already have some ideas about roles that interest you. Perhaps you’ve thought about consulting, but aren’t sure what a day in the life is like for that role. Or perhaps there’s a specific industry that interests you, like healthcare or finance, but you’re not sure what the different roles are within that industry. Whatever your starting point, this is an opportunity to cast a wide net to see what options interest you.

    Here are a few ways to research different career pathways.

        Search job descriptions with keywords related to your interest.
        Talk to others who are already in roles you’re interested in.
        Attend industry events and meetups.
        Take people in your network out for coffee or lunch to learn more about other functions, teams, and roles.
        Shadow someone doing what you’d like to do in the future.
        Look for opportunities to be part of a special project to learn new skills. 

    Labor Market Trends

    One thing to consider as you research career options is the labor market demand for specific skills and roles. What are the jobs and industries experiencing the highest growth, and where are there more opportunities?

    Salesforce roles span multiple functional areas, including sales, IT, marketing, business management, and operations. As businesses embrace the future of mobile, big data, IoT, and AI, Salesforce skills are becoming some of the hottest skills to have on your resume, and that demand is growing.

    Knowing where the demand for a specific skill set, such as Salesforce skills, is strong can give you a starting point for researching different career options that draw upon those skills.

    Here are some places to look for labor market information.

        Occupational Outlook Handbook
        Glassdoor’s 50 Best Jobs List 

    A Day in the Life

    Another factor to consider during your research is the day-to-day activities of different roles. Does the role require more time working with others or working alone? Is the workday structured with lots of meetings or more self-directed? What types of problems does the role solve?

    Once you’ve identified specific roles that interest you, search online to find more information about a typical day for that role. Use LinkedIn or X to find people in your network with that role and ask to interview them.

    For Salesforce career pathways, you can read stories from Trailblazers who have built their careers on Salesforce. Or explore a typical day in the life of different career paths on the Salesforce Career Paths site.
    Conducting Your Research

    We’ve provided some information on different career pathways within the Salesforce ecosystem as a starting point for researching career options that interest you. Read through the career profiles, the skills required, what a day in the life of each of these jobs is like, and some of the additional resources provided. You can also expand your exploration outside this list and do your own research on job roles that interest you.

    Once you’ve identified one or two roles that look interesting, complete the career exploration worksheet in the Career Exploration Resources packet you downloaded to do a deeper dive on those career options.

    Land Your Next Opportunity
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Prepare for interviewing by creating your elevator pitch.
        Create your Salesforce resume and profile.
        Connect with employers. 

    Now You're Ready!

    Now that you know where you’re headed and you’ve created your plan to get there, it’s time to go out and land that next role. We’ve created a job seeker checklist, included in the Resources pack you downloaded, to help you make sure your personal presence is amazing both in person and online.

    You’re ready!
    Update Your Resume

    If you haven’t updated your resume in a while, it’s time to dust it off and add in your most recent work experience, and any new skills and certifications you’ve earned.

    If you’re making a major career change or changing industries, consider hiring a professional to help you position your previous experience that is relevant for the new role.

    Make sure you proofread your resume carefully. Have a friend or family member read it over if you can. You don’t want to miss out on an opportunity because you missed a typo.

    Here are a few additional tips for creating a rock star resume.

    	

    DO THIS
    	

    NOT THIS

    Use action verbs
    	

    Trained 500 users on new sales processes.
    	

    Responsible for end-user training.

    Highlight accomplishments
    	

    Designed an automated lead qualification process using Salesforce that resulted in XYZ.
    	

    Automated processes using Salesforce.

    Be accurate
    	

    Include dates for each position you’ve held.
    	

    Don’t leave off information.

    Don’t lie or provide incorrect information.
    Create Your Elevator Pitch

    An elevator pitch is the 30-second story of who you are and where you want to go, and it usually ends with a specific ask or request. It’s your personal “commercial.” Hone and practice it until you can deliver it smoothly.

    Your elevator pitch is the perfect response to questions like, “Tell me about yourself” or “What do you do?” It can prepare you for that chance encounter with the company CEO in the elevator (or in the line at the coffee shop, or anywhere!).

    You can have slightly different versions of your pitch, depending on who you’re talking to, but the basic structure is the same.

    Elements to include
    	

    Examples

    Who are you? What is your goal?
    	

        I’m an experienced Salesforce administrator looking to move into a consulting role...
        I’m a recent MBA graduate looking for a role at a nonprofit... 

    Why are you pursuing this goal? What is your motivation?
    	

        I love helping teams optimize their use of Salesforce and tackling new challenges.
        I’ve been an avid hiker and camper since I was a kid, and I want to work for an organization that’s environmentally focused. 

    What are the skills and strengths you bring? What is your key differentiator?
    	

        I have 5 years’ experience as a Salesforce administrator, and I am a self-taught developer. I’ve earned 85 Trailhead badges and multiple certifications.
        I’ve successfully implemented Salesforce for a nonprofit, and I’m an expert with the Nonprofit Success Pack. 

    What is your ask? What are the next steps?
    	

        Can I get your business card to follow up and ask you a few questions?
        Do you have any recommendations of people I can speak with?
        Are you available to grab coffee in the next couple weeks? 

    Polish Your Personal Brand

    Your social media presence is the new resume. Employers and recruiters look to social media to learn more about candidates, so it’s important to make sure your profiles are top notch and that your personal brand is epic, amazing, and every bit as professionally compelling as you are in real life.

    Consider getting a professional headshot taken to use for all your social media profiles. Or use the best recent photo you have.

    DO THIS...
    	

    NOT THAT...

    Your profile picture:

        Looks like you
        Is clear and in focus
        Is high-resolution (1400 x 425 pixels) 

    	

    Your profile picture does not:

        Include other people
        Look like you from 10 years ago
        Look out of focus or blurry 

    Salesforce Profiles

    Complete your profile on Trailhead. Make sure you have a professional photo and use your newly perfected elevator pitch for your bio.

    X

    The Salesforce community is on X, so that’s a great place to look for news and information as well as establish yourself as a thought leader.

    	

    DO THIS
    	

    NOT THAT

    X handle
    	

    Choose an X handle that represents you professionally.

        One option is to use some version of your name, like @SusanSmith.
        Or use a handle that identifies your area of expertise, like @SusanCRMpro. 

    	

    Don’t use a handle that can be considered offensive.

    Profile
    	

    Use a professional photo.

    Use your 160-character bio to describe to employers your key skills and accomplishments.

    Include a link to your LinkedIn profile or other site where employers can get more information.
    	

    Don’t write your personal memoir.

    Don’t leave it blank or empty, and don’t sell yourself short.

    Content
    	

    Tweet primarily about things that relate to your role or industry (consider setting up two accounts if you do a lot of personal tweeting).

    Follow people and companies that you’re interested in.
    	

    LinkedIn

    Show off the skills you’ve acquired on Trailhead by listing your badges and superbadges as well as any certifications.

    	

    DO THIS
    	

    NOT THAT

    Job title and headline
    	

    Use your current actual job title.

    If you are looking for work use a job title that conveys the type of role that you want to land..
    	

    Your job title shouldn’t lie. Tell it like it is. It’s a small world out there—it’s surprising how many connections you share with others. So keep it honest.

    Summary section
    	

    Include a short description of yourself and what you do currently.

    Make sure your contact information is up to date.

    Market yourself as a leader—if you speak at events or have been recognized in your industry, make sure it’s on your profile.
    	

    Don’t write your personal memoir.

    Don’t leave it blank or empty, and don’t sell yourself short.

    Don’t include anything that seems outlandish or too personal.

    Rich media
    	

    Share content 2 to 3 times a week to keep your name fresh and to establish your professional brand.

    Add key work examples to your profile where appropriate.
    	

    Don’t add things that aren’t relevant to your career and might confuse the viewer.

    Don’t overwhelm people by sharing content multiple times per day.
    Research Prospective Companies

    Another important step in creating your career plan is identifying what type of company you want to work for so you can narrow your search. There are many types of companies within the Salesforce ecosystem where Salesforce skills are in demand. Here are a few examples.

        Salesforce customers: Salesforce customers span industries and include both large enterprise companies and small and medium-sized businesses. Check out our customer success stories for examples.
        Implementation partners: Our partners, also called system integrators, have deep technology and industry expertise and help get Salesforce up and running. They include international firms, and local and industry-specific partners who can give you a tailor-made implementation.
        AppExchange partners: These are companies that have built applications on the Force.com platform and sell them on AppExchange.
        Nonprofits: There are over 20,000 Salesforce nonprofit customers. See Salesforce.org success stories for examples. 

    Here are some questions to ask yourself in narrowing your search.

        Do you prefer working for a small company or a large enterprise?
        Do you prefer a startup or a more established organization?
        What type of company culture do you prefer?
        Do you want to work for a nonprofit or mission-driven organization or a commercial enterprise?
        What industry are you most interested in? 

    Search for Salesforce Opportunities

    Ready to start your search? In addition to the general job sites such as dice.com, monster.com, and others, there are many specific job boards for Salesforce roles. Here are a few of the job boards.

        AppExchange Jobs Marketplace: Search for jobs by location or title, or post your profile for employers to find.
        Jobs at Salesforce: Work at the company voted “most innovative company in the world” for the past 5 years by Forbes magazine.
        Trailblazer Community: There are various groups dedicated to job search and job postings such as the Jobs Postings group. 

    Connect with a Recruiter

    Connect with recruiters that specialize in finding candidates for Salesforce roles. Here are just a few of the recruiters that specialize in recruiting talent with Salesforce skills.

        Mason Frank International
        Hire On-Demand
        Tech2 Resources 

    Apply for a Job

    Once you’ve identified an opportunity that you want to apply for, search on LinkedIn. See if there’s anyone in your network who works at that company and can provide more information or a recommendation or introduction.

    Review the company’s website and social media to learn more about the company’s business, culture, and products or services.

    Create a cover letter tailored to that job posting. Make sure you address how you fulfill the specific skills and competencies the employer is looking for, using the language they’ve used. Update your resume as needed to better target your experience to the posting.

    Feel free to use the job seeker checklist included in the Career Exploration Resource pack you downloaded.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain the purpose of a workforce development program.
        Describe the Workforce Navigators program.
        Identify the benefits of the Workforce Navigators program.

    What Are Workforce Development Programs?

    In simple terms, workforce development programs are a set of solutions that support job seekers in advancing their skill sets to meet current and future employment needs.

    Recent Mckinsey studies indicate that taking a skills-based approach to building the future workforce is key. Employers and employees alike benefit from programs where job seekers gain new skills for better opportunities and increase the talent pipeline to meet future demands. 

    Programs vary. They can include anything from specialized training to address a specific need for a company, to content with basic interview tips to help individuals succeed with their job search. Today, organizations across private industries, non-government, local agencies, and more offer workforce development programs. 

    At Salesforce, we provide workforce development through a set of diverse programs dedicated to training and hiring for the jobs of tomorrow. These efforts stress equality for all. Our Workforce Navigators program aims to ensure that professionals with disabilities have the same opportunities as their peers to advance their career through training, mentorship, and certification opportunities within the Salesforce ecosystem.

    Salesforce is in a unique position. We can foster our program of inclusion across partner organizations and customers and expand the reach and networks for job seekers with disabilities.

     
    Committed to Equality and Inclusion

    At Salesforce, equality is one of our core company values. And we believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity to learn and grow. 

    Everyone has a different path to career success, and we’re committed to empowering people with disabilities to find their success in the Salesforce ecosystem and to providing support on their journey. The Workforce Navigators program is an external-facing workforce development program within the Office of Accessibility at Salesforce.  

    Established in 2020 and designed for job seekers with disabilities, Workforce Navigators supports individuals who want to learn more about Salesforce through learning opportunities, mentorship, and certification access. 

    Since its inception, Workforce Navigators has helped many job seekers with disabilities along their journey. Through the program, we’ve partnered with multiple companies to help them develop a more inclusive and accessible career path for candidates with disabilities seeking employment.

    Whether you’re a job candidate with a disability or an HR practitioner working in the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) space, inside or outside the Salesforce ecosystem, we want to help. We partner with companies to help them upskill their employees and offer the public free digital training, publishing resources, and more. Commitment to Workforce Development 

    “We can and should do more. My dream would be a call to action for business leaders, to show that business can be a great platform for change. Business and government together can create world-class educational and apprenticeship programs to invest in the future of our workforce.”  —Marc Benioff, CEO, Salesforce
    Inclusive by Design: Purpose-Filled Solutions

    You just learned that workforce development programs aim to help people develop new skills, and as a result create a well-trained workforce that can meet the growing demands of jobs in the future. Workforce Navigators takes this a step further by supporting Trailblazers with disabilities throughout their entire journey, ensuring accessible experiences every step of the way.

    We believe that a robust and actionable workforce development program that supports professionals with disabilities includes the following elements.

        A referral stream for professionals with disabilities seeking career advancement opportunities.
        Accessible training and learning materials universally designed for inclusion.
        Opportunities for paid work experience to build an individual’s resume.

    By supporting professionals with disabilities through talent development, everyone can perform at their peak. We offer a network and structure to support growth through an entire career.

     
    Workforce Navigators Benefits

    Workforce Navigators offers myriad benefits–from accessible learning content to certification and scholarship support. As a job seeker, you can take advantage of learning content presented in the way that best works for you. And if financial support is a concern, you can apply for a scholarship to assist with your learning journey.

    For DEI practitioners or hiring managers, you have the opportunity to review programs that can be reapplied within your organization. And importantly, you can tap into a wealth of diverse talent to meet growing job demands. 

     
    Workforce Navigators in Action

    Molly just started a new job at a finance firm that operates on the Salesforce platform. She uses screen magnification in combination with a screen reader to enlarge content on the screen and also have it spoken aloud. She sometimes has trouble using the mouse; she is much faster using the keyboard to get work done. This is her first time using Salesforce, and she is searching for a community where she can pick up tips and tricks while she works her way through Trailhead.

    Molly has the opportunity to join Workforce Navigators for training, mentorship, and scholarships. She can also tap into the Workforce Navigators written accessibility resources like screen reader instructions and keyboard-only use.

    In the next unit, we take a closer look at the three key components of Workforce Navigators.

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe three ways to participate in the Workforce Navigators program.
        Access the Workforce Navigators website and resources.
        Discover how you can partner with Workforce Navigators.

    A Three-Tiered Approach to Support

    As you learned in the previous unit, Workforce Navigators is a workforce development program designed to support professionals with disabilities through mentorship, training, and scholarships. We take a multipronged approach to supporting job seekers with disabilities and training. There are many benefits of Workforce Navigators. Let’s explore!

    Training

    When you join Workforce Navigators, Salesforce learning opportunities expand and open up to you, beginning with our rigorous and disciplined training. As part of Workforce Navigators, we offer both intensive, virtual bootcamps and self-paced, online curriculums. 

    Trailhead Virtual Bootcamp is a multi-week program that provides fundamental knowledge and expert-led guidance for building Salesforce skills quickly. Job seekers can join prescriptive bootcamps and learn directly from Salesforce experts through live sessions. Professionals looking to advance their career can find new opportunities and develop skills and prove their expertise by completing Trailhead badges or earning Salesforce certifications through the Bootcamp.

    To meet individual needs and schedules, job seekers can also get the same hands-on learning at their own pace. This flexible, self-paced option offers access to the Salesforce organization to practice new skills, test knowledge, and review learning resources.

    Scholarship Programs

    To help provide access to training for individuals who may need financial assistance, each year we award Trailhead Virtual Bootcamp scholarships to skilled professionals with disabilities who meet certain requirements. To apply, fill out the scholarship application. Currently, the scholarship is only available in the US and Canada.

    Mentorship Program

    Everyone deserves the chance to have a mentor. That’s why Salesforce’s Office of Accessibility created a dedicated mentorship program for people with disabilities. 

    Community is a key element for success, and our mentoring program can help you begin building yours. The Workforce Navigators Mentoring Program offers career support to people with disabilities who are exploring roles within the ecosystem, working toward Salesforce certification, or already certified. 

    With Workforce Navigators, you learn from the best. After you sign up for the mentorship program, we assign you a Salesforce employee mentor, who can help guide you through training and information about careers at Salesforce.

    Consider these mentorship benefits.

        Meet with a trusted and skilled mentor at least 2 hours per month.
        Share short-term and long-term career goals for insight and guidance.
        Get actionable advice and suggestions to improve your resume.
        Participate in mock interviews.

    Currently only available in the US and Canada, check out the mentorship program page to learn about the requirements (there are just a few) and how to enroll as a mentee. 
    Mentorship in Action 

    Janice has self-identified with a disability and is currently living in the US. She has taken advantage of the Workforce Navigators Program and has taken virtual bootcamp sessions and recently received her admin certification. She is now interested in taking the next step: enrolling in the mentorship program and continuing to build more community with Salesforce and its ecosystem.

    At Salesforce, we take great pride in helping pave the way to a more inclusive workforce. We recognize that fostering a more diverse and inclusive culture is a journey. Building community through individual outreach and in partnership with other companies and organizations is a key part of this journey. And it begins with individuals in the community who can help build and make connections with Workforce Navigators.

    We work with workforce development organizations to train, certify, and place people with disabilities in the Salesforce ecosystem. For example, we have partnerships with nonprofits like the Blind Institute of Technology and BOSMA. The Blind Institute of Technology is a nationwide organization whose aim is to reduce the unemployment rate within the blind and visually impaired community. BOSMA is an organization that partners with businesses to create jobs and training programs for people who are blind. 

    So what does “work with workforce development organizations” really mean? Let’s take a look.

    Akasia Parran has been legally blind for 5 years. The unmet need in her job search was accessible technology. As part of our partnership with the Blind Institute of Technology, Akasia had the opportunity to take a course that offers professionals with disabilities the chance to gain skills for meaningful employment. 

    The Salesforce free online learning modules offer enhanced accessibility features. For Akasia, that meant that she was able to complete coursework and became a certified Salesforce Administrator in just 6 months.

    “I wouldn’t have a career without Salesforce’s continuing efforts to create accessible software.” —Akasia Parran

    To learn more about Akasia’s story, read Breaking Accessibility Barriers and Becoming a Salesforce Pro.

    Remove Barriers: Pave the Way for a More Inclusive Hiring Experience

    Earlier in this unit, we mentioned that achieving inclusion and accessibility is a journey. It’s important to recognize that every company is at a different stage of development for inclusion. As a Trailblazer with a disability or an advocate for inclusion, we can all play a positive role in helping to improve the landscape. 

    Any one of us can be a change agent when we encounter a barrier to success. While most barriers are likely an oversight and not an intentional exclusion, it’s up to us all to drive culture changes that remove barriers and put in place best practices.

    If you feel you have experienced a barrier at any point in our hiring experience, we want to hear about it. Accessibility blockers on any software platform should be reported to the company’s accessibility team. If you find an accessibility blocker on the Salesforce platform, we welcome your feedback and have a system in place for reporting. Use this article to submit your accessibility issue and create a product accessibility support case.

    It’s also important to celebrate successes and best-in-class examples of inclusion and accessibility. View our events page for information about upcoming guest lectures. If you have a great story to share about your company, contact us to see if you can become part of our series.

    Next, let’s consider a scenario where an accessibility barrier prevented a professional from performing at their fullest potential. 
    Accessibility Barrier Example

    Jack finds a great role posted online with a company that has a strong reputation for valuing diversity. Jack is a cybersecurity expert and has been deaf since birth. He applies online for the role and is asked to take a few online tests to move forward in the interview process. Excited to begin, he opens the first test and discovers there's a video he must watch and answer questions about. Unfortunately, the video does not have captions. He does poorly on the exam, and the results are not representative of his actual expertise and knowledge.

    After he completes the test, he reaches out to his hiring contact to let them know the challenges he encountered. As it turns out, they have a version with captioning, and Jack is able to retake the test and successfully continue with the hiring process as a top candidate. And going forward, the company institutes a new policy to embed captioning into all its training videos so that new hires have the option of turning on captioning, as needed.

    Guard Data Transmission
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Define transport layer security (TLS).
        Identify how public key infrastructure (PKI) secures data transmission. 

    Encrypting Data Transmission with TLS

    One critical link in securing data transmission is to use transport layer security (TLS) to encrypt it. TLS is a cryptographic protocol designed to secure communications over a computer network. A protocol describes how the cryptographic algorithms should be used to secure information. Cryptographic protocols are used to secure transferred messages during application-level data transport. They are widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). But their use as the security layer in Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) remains the most publicly visible instance for secure web browsing.
    Using a PKI Service

    Many organizations use internal services to simplify the process of getting certificates for TLS. If your organization has such a service, you should use it for provisioning and delivering the short-lived certificates to hosts and services upon which TLS relies. If your organization does not have an internal service, you should consider planning for or adopting a public key infrastructure (PKI) service. A PKI service simplifies the process of encryption by setting up a system for acquiring the certificates that TLS uses to authenticate identity.

    Let’s start by looking at how a PKI service works. PKI is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. Digital certificates establish your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the web. They are issued by a certification authority (CA) who vouches for their authenticity. 

    In cryptography, a PKI is an arrangement that binds public keys with respective identities of entities (like people and organizations). A public key is the key your web browser uses to encrypt or scramble data into ciphertext, which is sent to a website. The data is then decrypted with a private key held by the entity that is authorized to view the data. The binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a CA. A CA confirms the validity of a website's certificate and, therefore, verifies that the website itself is valid. 

    Diagram that shows how the public key encrypts data on the client side and decrypts it on the server side

    In general, PKI provides “trust services.” Trust services is the process of ensuring the electronic identification of signatories and services. Trust service objectives respect one or more of the following capabilities: confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

    Confidentiality: Ensures that no entity can maliciously or unwittingly view your data in cleartext. Data is encrypted to make it secret so that even if it is read, it appears as gibberish. This is why the most common use of PKI for confidentiality purposes is in the context of TLS.

    Integrity: Ensures that if transmitted data is tampered with in any way, there is clear evidence that it happened. This traceability is a key trust objective of PKI systems.

    Authenticity: Ensures that you have connection certainty for authentication of data in transit on both the server-side and the client-side of the transmission.

    These trust services are why organizations use PKI services to generate certificates for data encryption over TLS. A certificate service is basically an organization of services surrounding a CA that allows it to issue, renew, and revoke certificates. Certificates are what pass a public key to computers that need to communicate securely using the PKI system.

    Your organization most likely has its own customized PKI service to generate the certificates you need to securely encrypt your data in transit using TLS. You should use that system to encrypt data in transit, so that you do not risk exposing yourself and your organization to attackers on the open internet who might wish to do you harm.

    Encrypt Data at Rest
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Define the risks to data at rest.
        Explain encryption best practices to protect data at rest. 

    What Is Data at Rest?

    Data at rest is the data housed on computer data storage in any digital form, whether it's in cloud storage, file hosting services, or databases. Data at rest can even include physical data stored in warehouses, spreadsheets, archives, or tapes. For the purposes of this module, data refers to electronic data. 

    Depending on the core business of your organization, data at rest can be one of the most valuable assets you have. That’s why this type of data is subject to threats from attackers. To prevent this data from being accessed or stolen, organizations often employ security protection measures such as password protection, data encryption, or a combination of both. Let’s take a closer look at encryption of data at rest. 

    Information protected by encryption both at rest and in transit.
    Use Encryption to Secure Organization Data at Rest

    Just as it’s crucial to encrypt data in transit, it’s also important to encrypt sensitive data at rest. This is to ensure that you handle private data securely, and that it stays private. Your goal when encrypting data at rest should be to implement a solution that prevents data visibility in the event of unauthorized access or theft. 

    When protecting data at rest, you want to make sure that encrypted data remains encrypted when other controls fail. Sometimes this is done by combining network segmentation and increasing levels of encryption. Encrypting data on multiple levels is a good way to enhance its safety. 

    At a minimum, you should: 

        Implement cryptography on the database housing the data and on the physical devices where the databases are stored.
        Update data encryption keys on a regular basis.
        Store encryption keys separately from the data.
        Enable crypto-shredding at the end of the data or hardware lifecycle.
        Audit sensitive data at scheduled intervals.
        Store only the minimum amount of sensitive data. 

    While there are many ways to configure encrypted data at rest systems, here are some basic best practices.

    Asymmetric cryptography (also known as public-key encryption) uses the difficulty of certain math problems to give you a pair of keys, each of which can be used to encrypt a message so that only the other key in the pair can decrypt it. That means anyone can use the public key to hide something, and only the holders of the private key can unlock it. The holders of the private key can also “sign” any message, and anyone in the world can use the public key to verify it was really signed by them. 

    Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption as it uses two keys for the process. In a symmetric key system, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, while in an asymmetric system, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret. Asymmetric cryptography tools include authentication tokens, Docker or Java’s JCA.  

    Hardware security module (HSM) is hardware that holds private keys and it can be used without disclosing them. While it's running, you can put public-key encrypted information on one end and get decrypted information out of the other, and nobody can ever discover the private key. 

    Defense in depth means applying controls at different layers of your technology stack so that you don’t rely on just one control to protect your data. One way to implement defense in depth when it comes to encryption is to combine your encryption capabilities with asymmetric cryptography and HSM. This means that even if parts of the system are compromised, it is still difficult to access all the data. 

    Strong encryption methods include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA). These are both encryption standards used by governments, technology companies, and other organizations. The difference between them is that AES is a symmetric key system, and RSA is an asymmetric key system. This means that AES uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while RSA uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt data. 
    Sum It Up

    In this module, you’ve learned more about protecting data transmission with TLS and PKI, and encrypting data at rest. Using these methods across the board minimizes the chance that attackers can access it. You can learn more about best practices in cybersecurity from real security practitioners by visiting the Cybersecurity Learning Hub on Trailhead.

    Safeguard Production Secrets
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Define key management solutions (KMS).
        Explain the value of using a KMS.
        Identify KMS methodologies.
        Define key management terms.

    What Is a Key Management Solution?

    Key management solutions (KMS) rely on a set of dedicated servers to administer a full lifecycle of cryptographic keys (keys used to encrypt data) and protect them from loss or misuse. KMS and other key management technologies ultimately control the generation, usage, storage, archival, and deletion of encryption keys. Additionally, to fully protect their loss or misuse, companies must limit access to these keys, either by restricting physical access or controlling user access by creating clear and defined user roles.

    Data encryption is the bedrock of cybersecurity. Encrypted data remains worthless ciphertext (encrypted or encoded text that is unreadable by humans or computers) to anyone who doesn't have access to the encryption keys. So, key management is—in turn—the key to encrypted data security. 

    Keys unlock your secrets, which means they pose a specific security risk if accessed by an unauthorized user. Somehow, you must keep track of the keys, decide who has access to them, and figure out how they can be accessed without being exposed. This is the central task of any KMS.
    Why KMS?

    KMS is designed to provide application owners a way to generate and manage cryptographic keys. These keys should be protected and managed in a secure and physical computing device—a hardware security module (HSM)—when possible. HSMs are designed and certified to be tamper-evident and intrusion-resistant, and they provide the highest level of physical security.

    A common mistake people make when encrypting data at rest is to use an inadequate key, or to store the key along with the encrypted data. This is the equivalent of leaving a key under the doormat of your house. It’s the first place a malicious actor looks for a key, and it puts your data in serious danger. Instead, make sure that keys only exist on devices in a transient state. That is, the user should enter them only so that the data can be decrypted and then erased from memory. 

    A thief looks under the doormat of a house and finds the key.
    KMS Methodologies

    There are various KMS methodologies that centralize key generation, distribution, and management. These allow you to maintain control of what keys are in use and who is using them.

    Traditional Public-Key Solutions

    One reason keys have been difficult to manage is that in a traditional public-key solution, a key is typically assigned to an individual, server, or organization. This key works like a signature, validating that the data has come from the proper source. In this technology solution, keypairs persist for years at a time, so the key must be carefully guarded against disclosure. Anyone with access to the private key can counterfeit that person's digital signature. 

    Transient-Key Solutions

    In transient-key solutions, the keypair is assigned to a brief interval of time, not to a particular person or entity. Data signed by a specific private key becomes associated with a specific time and date. A keypair is active only for a few minutes, after which the private key is permanently destroyed. Therefore, unlike public-key solutions, transient-key solutions do not depend upon the long-term security of the private keys. A KMS works as a transient-key solution. Larger organizations use a KMS with an HSM to provide a very high level of security.
    Key Management Terms

    Let’s talk about some cryptographic key terms you might encounter when working with KMS solutions. 

    Password versus key: In Secrets Management for Developers, you learned about the difference between a password and a key. Remember that the primary difference between keys and passwords is that the latter are intended to be generated, read, remembered, and reproduced by a human user. A key, by contrast, is intended for use by the software that is implementing the cryptographic algorithm, so human readability is not required. In fact, most users will, in most cases, be unaware of the existence of the keys being used on their behalf by the security components of their everyday software applications.

    Symmetric versus asymmetric keys: Asymmetric key algorithms use separate keys for encryption and decryption, while symmetric key algorithms use a single key for both processes. Because an asymmetric algorithm uses multiple keys, the process takes longer to produce than a symmetric key algorithm does. However, the benefit is that an asymmetric algorithm is much more secure than a symmetric key algorithm.

    Cryptographic hash: This is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size (the hash value, hash, or message digest). Hashing is a cryptographic process that can be used to validate the authenticity and integrity of various types of input. It is widely used in authentication systems to avoid storing plaintext passwords in databases, but is also used to validate files, documents and other types of data.

    Cryptographic salt: This is the random data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password, or a passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage.

    A KMS solution protects your secrets as follows: A developer uses KMS to create or store a secret using the KMS producer service. The producer generates a new secret, embeds authorization by attaching the set of services that are allowed to access it, and encrypts it. The developer receives the resulting encrypted blob to check-in to source control along with their application. The encrypted secret is deployed to production along with the application, where it is decrypted and exposed to code via an in-memory file system.

    Manage Your Keys
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Define the key management lifecycle.
        Explain the different approaches to key management solutions (KMS).

    Key Management Lifecycle

    Now that you’ve learned how to keep your production secrets safe, let’s talk about the key management lifecycle and why it’s equally important for security. While there are many phases to this lifecycle, key management focuses on creating, maintaining, securing, and controlling the use of cryptographic keys. Monitoring this process allows you to assure that the keys are properly created and deployed. There are four phases to the key management lifecycle, which are important to securing production secrets. 

        Key Creation and Activation
        Key Revocation
        Key Escrow (Backup)
        Key Deletion (Destruction)

    Let’s take a closer look at each.

    Key Creation and Activation

    A key manager creates the encryption key and stores it in a key storage database along with its attributes: name, activation date, size, and so forth. You can activate keys at creation or set them to activate later.

    Key Revocation

    Any key administrator can use the key manager to revoke a key. This places the key in an invalidated state and it can no longer be used for cryptographic purposes like encryption and decryption. If needed, you can reactivate revoked keys. An example of this may be when an old key is required to decrypt data previously encrypted with it.

    Key Escrow (Backup)

    Key escrow allows for keys to be securely archived when they deactivate. Much like key revocation, you can reactivate archived keys if required. 

    Key Deletion (Destruction)

    When a key is no longer necessary or has become compromised, an admin may choose to delete it from the storage database. This removes all or certain instances from the database, making recovery impossible (outside of any stored backups). Should a key become compromised, an admin can immediately delete it, allowing your data to remain secure.A cycle with symbols of each phase of the key management lifecycle: creation and activation, revocation, escrow, and destruction
    KMS Strategies

    An organization can take one of several different approaches when it comes to key management strategies: decentralized, distributed, or centralized.

    Manage Your Keys—Decentralized (Local)

    A decentralized key management solution (DKMS) or local key management is an approach to key management where no central authority exists. Individuals bear all the responsibility for creating, securing, managing, and destroying cryptographic keys. An example of this is local backup encryption or a local file vault on a computer.

    Manage Your Keys—Distributed (Siloed)

    Another approach is to use a distributed or siloed key management approach, where you consolidate the management for a particular application or system. A common example of this is full disk encryption that is used in large enterprise organizations. The keys for the disk encryption are all managed by a central application that is used specifically for that one purpose.

    Manage Your Keys—Centralized

    There is also the option of using a dedicated and centralized KMS (CKMS). Distributed key management solutions become increasingly difficult to manage as your company grows. A CKMS can unify key management across your entire company allowing for scale with the needs of the business. Benefits of a CKMS include providing tamper-evident records for proof of compliance along with streamlining key management processes, automatic key updates, and backup and recovery options. 

    It’s important to note that all of the above methods are available within the cloud, as well as your company’s on-premise system for key management. However, if scalability, auditing, and security are of high concern, CKMS is ideal. By managing keys in a centralized fashion, you reduce operational burdens and associated costs, while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of your keys.

    Implement Mobile Application Security
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Identify the Open Web Application Security Project’s mobile security resources.
        List actions to address improper platform usage.
        Describe how to mitigate insecure data storage, communication, and authentication.
        Explain the risk associated with insufficient cryptography.

    Before You Start

    If you completed the Mobile Application Security module, then you already know about the mobile application (app) landscape and key skills relevant to mobile application security (appsec) engineering. Now let’s talk about how to leverage the Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP’s) mobile security resources to help you address mobile security risks.
    OWASP’s Mobile Security Resources

    OWASP® is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of applications (apps) and software by providing guidelines through local and global conferences and open source software projects. These include the OWASP Mobile Top 10 project, web app project, application programming interface (API) security project, serverless computing project, and much more. In this module, we use the OWASP Mobile Top 10 as a framework to explain the way to implement mobile appsec.

    As a mobile application security (appsec) engineer, your challenge is to secure an ever-growing and constantly updating mobile app portfolio with finite resources. Thankfully, you can standardize and scale mobile appsec testing using the OWASP Mobile Security Project. The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile apps. You can use the OWASP’s mobile security resources to build efficient and effective mobile appsec programs. Let’s take a quick look at some of the OWASP’s mobile security resources.

    OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard 

    The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is a standard for mobile appsec. As a mobile appsec engineer, you can use the MASVS to develop more secure apps, and to ensure completeness and consistency of security test results. The goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation. The MASVS maps directly to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). 

    OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

    The OWASP MSTG is a project that seeks to define the industry standard for mobile appsec. It covers the processes, techniques, and tools you can use during a mobile appsec test, and an exhaustive set of test cases that enables you to deliver consistent and complete test results. The OWASP MSTG is a comprehensive manual for mobile appsec testing and reverse engineering for iOS and Android mobile security testers.

    OWASP Mobile Top 10

    The OWASP Mobile Top 10 list is a great resource for mobile appsec engineers who want to design and secure mobile apps, because many of them are inherently vulnerable to security risks. The OWASP Mobile Top 10 is a mobile security project focused on highlighting security vulnerabilities in mobile apps and the remediation strategies to mitigate the risk associated with them. This list sheds light on technical threats and highlights the risk to the business. Note that this list only covers some of the potential vulnerabilities that can be present in a mobile application and it is not comprehensive. 

    Here are the OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks.

        M1: Improper Platform Usage
        M2: Insecure Data Storage
        M3: Insecure Communication
        M4: Insecure Authentication
        M5: Insufficient Cryptography
        M6: Insecure Authorization
        M7: Poor Code Quality
        M8: Code Tampering
        M9: Reverse Engineering
        M10: Extraneous Functionality

    Manage Security Risks with the OWASP Mobile Top 10

    Let’s take a look at how you, as a mobile appsec engineer, can use the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to help better manage security risks in your mobile apps.

    Angeli is an Android operating system (OS) mobile appsec engineer at a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise mobile apps to manage business operations and customer relations.

    Angeli has been tasked with using the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to evaluate her organization’s mobile apps and verify that they’re secure. Let’s follow along as she does so.

    Note

    The scenarios below describe examples of each risk but do not represent an exhaustive list of issues that could occur under each risk.

    M1: Improper Platform Usage

    This risk covers the misuse of a mobile OS feature or a failure to use platform security controls properly. It might include Android intents, platform permissions, misuse of biometric authentication mechanisms, password storage tools, or some other security control that’s part of the mobile OS.

    During the evaluation of several of her company’s Android apps, Angeli notices that many of them are storing cryptographic keys on the file system. Because cryptographic keys are commonly used to secure particularly sensitive data they are a primary target for attackers.

    An unauthorized user could use a variety of attacks to read the keys from the file system. Angeli knows that storing cryptographic material on the standard file system is against Android’s best practices and that her organization is at risk of improper platform usage. She circles back with the development team to help them implement a solution using the Android keystore system to store the cryptographic keys as securely as possible.

    M2: Insecure Data Storage

    This risk covers a case where an adversary attains a lost or stolen mobile device or executes malware or another repackaged app on the mobile device. Angeli evaluates the organization’s apps for this risk, and realizes that an app is storing usernames and credentials in plain text in system logs.

    She circles back with the application development team to see if they performed a threat model on the app prior to release, in order to identify insecure storage as a possible risk. Noticing they did not perform one, she recommends that the application development manager incorporate threat modeling into the development process so that these bugs are identified before release.

    Angeli further recommends that the development team identify sensitive data that the app processes, stores, or transmits, and validate that the data isn’t unnecessarily exposed. Lastly, Angeli informs the development team to create and implement a plan as soon as possible for remediating and redeploying the mobile app. Angeli works with the development team to perform a root cause analysis to uncover why the vulnerability was not identified before deployment.

    M3: Insecure Communication

    This risk covers a case where a threat agent might exploit vulnerabilities to intercept sensitive data while it’s traversing the mobile device’s carrier network and the internet. This can occur if an adversary compromises or monitors your local Wi-Fi network, or if there’s malware on your mobile device capturing the sensitive data in transit.

    In evaluating her organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli realizes that one of the apps fails to verify that the certificate offered is valid, and instead unconditionally accepts any certificate offered to it by the server. This destroys any mutual authentication capability between the mobile app and the endpoint, and leaves the app vulnerable to manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through a transport layer security (TLS) proxy.

    An MITM attack occurs when a perpetrator positions themselves in a conversation between two parties, such as a user and an application. The intention is to either eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties by making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway and capturing sensitive data.

    To address this risk, Angeli works with the app development team to ensure the app only establishes a secure connection after verifying the identity of the endpoint server using trusted certificates in the keystore.

    M4: Insecure Authentication

    This risk covers a case where a threat agent exploits authentication vulnerabilities through attacks that use available or custom-built tools. In evaluating the organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli realizes that an app uses a weak password configuration policy to simplify how the user enters a password. She works with the application development team to replace the 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) currently allowed as an authentication credential with a stronger authentication mechanism, to make it more difficult for adversaries to deduce the password.

    M5: Insufficient Cryptography

    This risk covers a case where a threat agent has physical access to data that’s been encrypted improperly, or uses mobile malware to take advantage of insufficient encryption on a mobile device. In evaluating her organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli discovers that an app uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which has been shown to have significant weaknesses. She works with the application development team to re-engineer the app to instead follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines on recommended algorithms.
    Sum It Up

    Angeli’s organization is on the road to having more secure apps—but her work here isn’t done. In the next unit, find out how Angeli protects her organization’s apps against the rest of the Mobile Top 10.

    Address Mobile Application Risks
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe how to address insecure authorization.
        List actions to improve code quality.
        Explain how to mitigate code tampering.
        Identify reverse engineering risks.
        Describe how to prevent extraneous functionality risks. 

    Address Mobile Risks

    Let’s continue to follow Angeli as she works to secure her organization’s mobile apps, using the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Mobile Top 10 as a guide.

    M6: Insecure Authorization

    This risk covers a case where a threat agent exploits authorization vulnerabilities through attacks that use available or custom-built tools. It’s important to recognize the difference between authentication and authorization. Authentication is the act of identifying an individual. Authorization is the act of confirming that the identified individual has the permissions necessary to perform the act. The two are closely related, as authorization checks should always immediately follow authentication of an incoming request from a mobile device.

    Upon inspecting the organization’s applications (apps) carefully, Angeli discovers that authorization decisions are being executed locally on the client-side of the mobile app during the authentication request. This could lead to a situation where an adversary could tweak an incoming request and masquerade as a member of a group they don’t belong to, to gain access to administrative functionality.

    Angeli works with the developers to update the app to authorize the roles and permissions of authenticated users using only information contained in back-end systems. She reminds them it’s important to avoid relying on any roles or permission information that comes from the mobile device itself.

    M7: Poor Code Quality

    This risk covers the case where a threat agent passes untrusted inputs to method calls (operators used to call self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task) made within mobile code. Threat actors typically exploit these poor code quality issues via malware or phishing scams.

    Working with the mobile app pen testing team, Angeli learns that the team has been able to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in one of the organization’s apps. The exploit allows them to write into areas known to hold executable code and replace it with malicious code. She works with the development team to reengineer the code by marking certain regions within the code as nonexecutable—a technique known as executable space protection. They also implement bounds checking to automatically check that data written to a buffer is within acceptable boundaries. Finally, Angeli works with the team to implement an automated process to identify future buffer overflows through the use of third-party static analysis tools.

    M8: Code Tampering

    This risk covers the case where the organization’s apps do not implement code signing. The lack of code signing allows an attacker to tamper with the app’s code. Typically, this attack occurs when an attacker tweaks a legitimate app’s code after downloading it from a popular app store. The attacker modifies the app to include malicious code then uploads it to a lesser known third-party app store, where an unsuspecting user downloads it.

    Angeli discovers that an attacker has created a counterfeit version of one of her organization’s apps. The counterfeit version captures and transmits the user’s personally identifiable information (PII), along with their username/password, to a third-party site. This allows the attacker to use the information for fraudulent purposes.

    Angeli contacts both app stores to inform them of the fraudulent use. She provides her app’s signature (distinctive, pattern-based detection methods which use expressions or marks for identifying app traffic), so the store can verify that her company is the legal owner of the app. They remove the unauthorized copies of the app from their stores, replacing it with the signed version. Angeli puts in place a plan to continually monitor the major app stores to check for any new unauthorized versions that have been published, and to submit new reclaiming requests on a regular basis.

    M9: Reverse Engineering

    This risk covers the case where an attacker downloads the targeted app from an app store and analyzes it within their own local environment using a suite of different tools to see how it works. The attacker uses reverse engineering to reveal sensitive and unencrypted information about back-end servers, cryptographic constants and ciphers, intellectual property, and more.

    Working with the mobile app pen testing team to evaluate one of the organization’s apps, Angeli discovers that an attacker would be able to run strings against the unencrypted app and find a hard-coded connection string that contains authentication credentials to a back-end database. An attacker could use those credentials to gain access to the database and steal PII data about the app’s users. Angeli consults with the development team on a remediation, and they decide to remove the hard-coded connection string and replace the functionality with a server side access controlled API to provide the required data to the application.

    M10: Extraneous Functionality

    This risk covers the case where an attacker seeks to understand extraneous functionalities or unnecessary components within a mobile app to discover hidden functionality in back-end systems. The attacker can typically exploit extraneous functionality directly from their own systems without any involvement by end users.

    Working with the organization's pen testing team, Angeli discovers that the mobile app developers included backdoor functionality in one of the organization’s apps that was not intended for release into production environments. An attacker could discover this functionality and use it to execute back-end administrative functions. To prevent this from happening in the future, Angeli works with her organization to implement manual, secure code reviews using subject matter experts most knowledgeable with this code.

    The subject matter experts make sure to examine the app’s configuration settings to discover any hidden switches, remove test code from the final production release, and examine all application programming interface (API) endpoints accessed by the mobile app to verify that they’re well documented and publicly available. They also examine log statements to ensure nothing overly descriptive about the back end is being written to the logs. Thanks to the OWASP Mobile Top 10, Angeli’s organization is now much more secure.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Identify the differences between static application security testing and dynamic application security testing.
        Define interactive application security testing and runtime application self-protection.

    Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing

    As mobile applications (apps) continue to grow as an attack vector, your organization should prioritize mobile application security (appsec) to fortify its overall security posture. Adversaries employ both static attacks based on source code itself and dynamic attacks that exploit app functionality. Understanding and remediating mobile app vulnerabilities in your code is vital for your mobile appsec program.

    Mobile appsec testing is the process of analyzing mobile apps to find security weaknesses, such as misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. Testing your apps regularly decreases the chance of vulnerabilities occuring or being exploited. Static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) are the most popular evaluation techniques available to you in order to secure mobile apps during the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

    Static Application Security Testing

    SAST is about the prevention of defects, whereas DAST is about finding and fixing the defects. While you perform SAST testing in the early stages of the SDLC, before deploying code into production environments, you perform DAST later in the lifecycle. Static and dynamic testing complement one another, and each type has a distinct approach to detecting bugs.

    You use SAST to analyze source code for known vulnerabilities as a form of white-box testing that scans and analyzes source code at rest from the inside out. SAST is programming-language dependent. You perform SAST to check the defects in software without actually executing the code of the mobile app. SAST tooling scans the source code looking for potentially vulnerable patterns and provides a list of results that then are triaged to weed out false positives. A false positive is a mislabeled security vulnerability indicating there is a threat when, in actuality, there isn't.

    A hand holding a mobile phone with an SAST checklist on the screen

    SAST is often referred to as verification: the evaluation of the development process. Though the most mature and easiest to deploy of the appsec testing tools, SAST scans are slow and often prone to high false-positive rates when identifying potential vulnerabilities. 

    Dynamic Application Security Testing

    DAST is a form of black-box testing you perform by executing the mobile app’s code. You use it to look for vulnerabilities by simulating external attacks on an application while it runs in a test environment. You use DAST to penetrate an application from the outside by checking its exposed interfaces for weaknesses. 

    In DAST, you work with the actual mobile app, not some artifact or model that represents the system. You provide an input, receive output, and compare the output to the expected behavior. You use test cases for testing processes and study how the code behaves during execution. DAST is often referred to as validation: the evaluation of a finished product. You do this testing as one of the last steps before deployment in a test environment, and after code deployment. As a result, fixing problems at this stage becomes more expensive because the product is actively in use.

    DAST is programming-language agnostic and is a good method for preventing regressions. However, it’s hard to automate and scale because you need experienced security professionals to tailor these test tools to specific use cases, making it more difficult to create a comprehensive testing strategy for each app. DAST also cannot pinpoint the exact source of the problem (for example, the line of code). Furthermore, it can generate a lot of false positives. 

    Examples of methodologies for dynamic testing are unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.

        Unit Testing: Testing of individual modules by developers
        Integration Testing: Testing the interface between different modules when they are joined
        System Testing: Testing performed on the system as a whole
        Acceptance Testing: Testing done from the user’s point of view

    The following table summarizes the differences between SAST and DAST.

    While both tools have their advantages and disadvantages, using them in tandem—along with interactive application security testing (IAST) and runtime application self-protection (RASP)—helps strengthen your app’s security, one testing technique at a time. Let’s take a look! 
    Interactive Application Security Testing and Runtime Application Self-Protection

    Interactive Application Security Testing

    SAST and DAST only provide a snapshot in time of a mobile app’s security weaknesses. These tools alone can’t keep up with today’s agile SDLC processes. This means that development, operations, and security teams are often one step behind as they develop, test, and transition software into production environments. To make it easier for businesses, appsec tool manufacturers realized that SAST and DAST techniques could be merged together to create better, more efficient tools that would include the advantages of both. This is how interactive application security testing (IAST) was born.

    IAST analyzes code for security vulnerabilities while the app is run by an automated test, human tester, or any activity “interacting” with the app functionality. While DAST provides an outside perspective on the app before it goes live, IAST uses software instrumentation (an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance and diagnose errors) to analyze running apps.

    IAST techniques cover more code, produce better results, and verify a broader range of security rules faster than either SAST or DAST tools working alone. IAST solutions deploy agents and sensors in running apps and continuously analyze all app interactions initiated by manual tests, automated tests, or a combination of both, to identify vulnerabilities in real time. If a vulnerability is detected, the tester or testing team is notified.

    This analysis allows developers to pinpoint the source of an identified vulnerability and fix it quickly. IAST also produces less false positives and false negatives (misidentified security vulnerabilities that claim you don’t have vulnerability when you do) than SAST and DAST, decreasing the workload on scarce security resources and making it easier to identify the most critical flaws.

    IAST tools are not confined to a particular phase of the SDLC. Even though they deliver a lot of value during the development phase, because they help developers fix risks in real time, IAST tools are incredibly useful during the testing phase as well. They’re also valuable when the system is in production, because operations and appsec teams can benefit from the risk detection, with little performance hit and little risk of false positives. While IAST tools can provide good benefits, they also are more complex to implement correctly and require mature security development practices and comprehensive build integration in order to recognize their benefits.

    Runtime Application Self-Protection

    While IAST monitors an app for security vulnerabilities while it’s running, runtime application self-protection (RASP) monitors an app to detect and prevent fraudulent activities even before it runs, effectively protecting the app from both known and unknown (zero-day) attack vectors. You can use RASP to gain insight into an app's internal data and state, and identify threats at runtime that may have otherwise been overlooked by other security solutions. When an app begins to run, RASP can protect it from malicious input or behavior by analyzing both the app's behavior and the context of that behavior.

    One advantage of RASP is that it requires minimal intervention of an administrator during deployment. When a security event in an app occurs, RASP takes control of the app and addresses the problem. In diagnostic mode, RASP will simply sound an alarm that something is amiss. In protection mode, it will try to stop it. For this reason, RASP can be beneficial to businesses with lean security resources because it can automatically block attacks on the spot without the need for human intervention. It’s important to first implement RASP in diagnostic mode, to observe how the tool makes decisions, before implementing protection mode.

    You likely use other technologies such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and web application firewalls (WAF) to protect your apps at runtime, but these technologies work in-line as they inspect network traffic and content. Although they analyze traffic and user sessions to and from apps, they cannot see how traffic and data are being processed within apps themselves. Additionally, instead of analyzing preset signatures or known patterns based on commonly known attacks, as a WAF would, you can use RASP to look for suspicious actions taking place in the app. 
    Sum It Up

    You now have a better understanding of how to use SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP to test and secure your mobile apps.

    Next, let’s turn to how to use network and mobile app penetration testing (pen testing) to further secure them.

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain network testing.
        Describe mobile application penetration testing.

    Network Testing

    Mobile devices regularly connect to a variety of networks, including public Wi-Fi networks shared with other (potentially malicious) clients. This creates opportunities for a wide variety of network-based attacks ranging from simple to complex and old to new. Therefore, it’s vital to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information exchanged between the mobile application (app) and remote service endpoints. 

    One best practice is to verify your mobile app sets up a secure, encrypted channel for network communication using the latest version of transport layer security (TLS) protocol with appropriate settings.

    Network security specialists, pen testers, and mobile application security (appsec) engineers conduct regular pen testing and vulnerability checks to enable smooth and secure functioning of mobile apps. They test how the app performs under various network types, connection speeds, and quality levels including slow and interrupted connections. They also attempt to circumvent the security of the app by trying to exploit the app’s functionality through pen testing.
    Mobile Application Pen Testing

    A mobile app pen test emulates an attack specifically targeting a custom mobile app and aims to enumerate all vulnerabilities within the app. Pen testing can be used across the entire spectrum of an IT infrastructure, including network, web application, and database. But today, we also see pen testing used widely for another segment: mobile appsec.

     

    You perform pen tests of mobile apps for security vulnerabilities by using either manual or automated techniques to analyze the app. You use these techniques to identify security flaws that may occur in the mobile app. Your purpose in pen testing is to ensure that the mobile app is not vulnerable to attack and that mitigations are in place to prevent exploitation.

    Pen testing requires a diligent effort to find weaknesses, just like an attacker would. You perform deep-dive testing into local on-device security issues, back-end web services, and the application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect them. You customize assessments to specific concerns, such as reverse engineering an iOS app or malware threats to an Android app. 

    During pen testing, you simulate multiple attack vectors and risks, including insecure storage, stolen device risk, mobile malware attacks, and both authenticated and unauthenticated app users. By conducting pen testing, you can gain insights into the application’s vulnerabilities, bottlenecks, and attack vectors before an adversary is able to discover and exploit them. This way, once you identify an app’s shortcomings, your developers can put in fixes to plug these gaps and change the design to address the issues at hand.

    Broadly speaking, mobile app pen testing methodologies include the following stages.

        Discovery: You gather information, which will further form the basis of the pen testing phases.
        Assessment and analysis: You assess the app using static application security testing (SAST), reverse engineering, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and more.
        Exploitation: You find hidden cues which can successfully shed light on different vulnerabilities.
        Reporting: You report the findings via technical reports and executive-level papers.

    Sum It Up

    In this module, you’ve been introduced to the OWASP Mobile Top 10 as a way to identify and mitigate mobile appsec risks. You’ve also learned how to test mobile apps using a variety of techniques.

    Along with the information you reviewed in the Mobile Application Security module, you should now have a better understanding of what it takes to be a mobile appsec engineer. You can learn more about the in-demand cybersecurity skills needed to get a job in mobile appsec, or another field, and learn more from real security practitioners by visiting the Cybersecurity Learning Hub on Trailhead.

    Score Risks
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Identify information assets, Safeguards, and vulnerabilities.
        Evaluate current Safeguard Maturity.
        Describe how the Center for Internet Security, Inc.’s (CIS®) Risk Assessment Method (RAM) automatically scores risks.

    Note

    This module was produced in collaboration with the CIS. Learn more about partner content on Trailhead.
    Before You Start

    If you completed The Center for Internet Security's Risk Assessment Method module, then you already know how to develop Risk Assessment and Acceptance Criteria. Now let’s talk about how to use the Center for Internet Security, Inc.’s (CIS) Risk Assessment Method (RAM) to model and evaluate risks and recommend and evaluate CIS Safeguards.

    Note

    Throughout this module, we capitalize common words when referring to a specific component of CIS RAM Version 2.1.
    Identify Information Assets, Safeguards, and Vulnerabilities

    As a cybersecurity risk manager, you can model risks by associating information assets with the CIS Safeguards that protect them, the vulnerabilities that may be present, and the threats that can compromise these information assets. CIS RAM helps analyze risk by describing the component steps regardless of sequence.

        Identify an information asset or asset class, such as a specific firewall or a set of similarly managed firewalls, an application, or a set of identically configured servers, and more.
        Identify threats that can compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of those information assets or Asset Classes.
        List CIS Safeguards that protect the information asset or Asset Class against foreseeable threats.
        Indicate if you have implemented the CIS Safeguards in the environment and how you have implemented them.
        Consider any vulnerabilities that may exist related to each Safeguard and Asset Class. You, as a cybersecurity risk manager, should take care to consider what can go wrong, even if you have implemented Safeguards. Safeguards can have vulnerabilities such as errors in administration, new threats, intentional harm, failed systems, and insufficient skills or resources.

    Let’s check in with Sean, the risk assessor at Custom Car Company (CCC), as he continues to fill out his Risk Register in CIS RAM for Implementation Group 2 (IG2) Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook.

    Sean filling out his Risk Register using CIS RAM for IG2 v2.1 Companion Workbook

    Using the workbook, Sean first selects an Asset Class such as Enterprise, Devices, Applications, Data, Network, or Users. 

    Next, he describes the Asset Name. He selects the CIS Safeguard # and Title that applies to the Asset Class he selected. He then documents how CCC has implemented that Safeguard, including optionally adding Evidence of Implementation, and states any Vulnerabilities that may be exploited by a threat. 

    Note

    This table represents just a few examples of the information Sean inputs.

    Now that Sean has documented CCC’s assets, associated CIS Safeguards, and Vulnerabiliites, he next turns to evaluate the current maturity of CIS Safeguards at CCC.
    Evaluate Current Safeguard Maturity

    As the next step in evaluating risks, Sean selects a score of 1 through 5 designating the reliability of each Safeguard’s effectiveness against threats, using the following definitions. 

        He did not implement the Safeguard, or implemented it inconsistently.
        He implemented the Safeguard  fully on some assets, or partially on all assets.
        He implemented the Safeguard on all assets.
        He tested the Safeguard and corrected inconsistencies.
        He has put in place mechanisms for the Safeguard to ensure consistent implementation over time.

    He populates the Safeguard Maturity Score column in the risk register with his selections.

    Automatically Score Risks

    The VERIS Community Database Index

    Sean now has documented CCC’s assets, their associated Vulnerabilities, and the maturity of CCC’s current CIS Safeguard implementation in protecting against those Vulnerabilities.

    CIS RAM Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook automatically calculates a value to represent how commonly a related threat causes reported cybersecurity incidents. The VERIS Community Database (VCDB) Index column displays this number. This score evaluates the commonality of a threat that a given Safeguard prevents. 

    Expectancy Score

    CIS RAM v2.1 Companion Workbook also automatically calculates an Expectancy Score by comparing the commonality of reported threats to the maturity of the Safeguards that prevent the threats.

    Note

    For more detailed information on how the CIS RAM Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook calculates the Expectancy Score, see Appendix C of the CIS-RAM for Implementation Group 2 (IG2) v2.1 PDF.

    Impacts

    Recall that in The Center for Internet Security's Risk Assessment Method module, Sean defined Mission Impact, Operational and Financial Objectives Impact, and Obligations Impact for each Asset Class (Enterprise, Devices, Applications, Data, Network, Users), as part of the process of estimating inherent risk criteria. The CIS RAM v21 Companion workbook automatically populates these magnitudes of harm.

    Risk Score and Risk Level

    Once Sean populates the Safeguard Maturity Score column of CIS RAM v2.1 Companion Workbook, the workbook automatically populates Risk Score and Risk Level.

    The workbook calculates the Risk Score by multiplying the Expectancy Score by the highest Impact Score. The resulting Risk Level is either green, yellow, or red. These colors indicate whether the risk evaluated as “acceptable” as Sean described it in his Risk Acceptance Criteria in the previous module.

        Green indicates that the risk evaluates as acceptable.
        Yellow indicates that the risk is unacceptably high, but not urgent.
        Red indicates that the risk is urgent.

    Sean’s completed Risk Register now looks like this:

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List the benefits of Visual Remote Assistant.
        Describe how a technician or agent uses Visual Remote Assistant.

    Meet the Ursa Major Solar Team

    Ursa Major Solar is an innovative solar company in the American Southwest. It sells individual solar products and complete solar power systems. It uses Field Service to manage the field service team that installs and repairs solar systems. Let’s meet a few members of the team working to improve the field service journey for its customers.

        CEO and cofounder Sita Nagappan-Alvarez. She makes key decisions about software purchases. She’s always on the lookout for ways to improve customer service while keeping her employees happy.
        Salesforce admin Maria Jimenez. She’s the go-to person for setting up and maintaining Salesforce and Field Service. If you have a question about Salesforce, Maria has the answer.
        Customer support agent Ada Balewa. She takes customer calls and solves their problems. Sometimes she refers customers to technicians, and sometimes she solves their problems herself.
        Field Service technician James Clifton. He fixes customers’ solar products. James works with all Ursa Major Solar’s products, and he’s happy to bring sunshine to its customers.

    Make Service Easier and Safer for Customers

    Sita keeps Ursa Major Solar at the forefront of the industry by making sure she knows what her customers want and what they don’t. These days, customers don’t want to have service technicians in their homes as often. While they’re happy with the service provided by technicians like Ada and James, they’d like to have Ursa Major help them perform simple jobs themselves.

    Having agents or technicians investigate problems in customers’ homes without going inside seems like an unsolvable problem. Then Sita discovers Visual Remote Assistant. Visual Remote Assistant lets a contact center agent or remote technician see what the customer sees via video session. Now Ursa Major can provide the same exceptional service without being in the customer’s house using real-time visual support. A quick wave of a customer’s mobile device shows the agent or technician which product is installed, the settings it’s currently using, and more.

    Visual Remote Assistant ties into Ursa Major’s existing Field Service product, so remote technicians can easily see customer information. Details like product type, installation date, and previous visits to the customer’s home are easy to access. Technicians don’t waste time asking questions they’ve asked before and save time for the customer and Ursa Major. Even better, customer problems are often resolved in the first call, without the customer having to schedule a service call and wait for a technician.

    What they see varies depending on how it’s set up in their org, but here’s what an Ursa Major agent or technician sees during a call.

    Graphic showing the incoming phone call, customer information, and the pane to launch Visual Remote Assistant.

        Call (1)—What the customer sees during the Visual Remote Assistant session.
        Customer information (2)—The agent or technician’s page shows customer contact information, the installed assets, past work orders for this customer, and more.
        Visual Remote Assistant pane (3)—Where an agent or technician starts Visual Remote Assistant, allowing them to see what the customer sees and guide them to resolve their issue.

    Visual Remote Assistant in Action

    Let’s say that Ada Balewa is on the phone with a customer named Violet Winkle. Violet is having trouble with a leaky solar hot water heater. Ursa Major has been called out before about this leaky hot water heater, so Ada quickly reads the notes in the work order on that visit. Ada suspects a loose pipe fitting, but she has to see the hot water heater to be sure.

    She suggests that they transition to a video call so she can see what’s going on with Violet’s hot water heater. Violet agrees and Ada uses Visual Remote Assistant to send a text to Violet. Violet taps the link and it sends her to a web page in her mobile browser. She approves the terms and conditions and allows Visual Remote Assistant to access her phone’s camera for the duration of the call. Now Ada can see everything that Violet sees.

    Ada asks Violet to point her phone at the leak and follow it back. She quickly spots the problem. It’s a leaking pipe fitting, just like she thought. When she tries to explain its location, Violet doesn’t understand, so Ada draws a big red arrow on her screen. Because Visual Remote Assistant uses augmented reality, the arrow shows up on Violet’s phone screen too. Now they can both see where the problem is.

    Ada tells Violet to turn the fitting to the right to tighten it. After Violet does, she wipes off the pipe with a towel and checks that it’s no longer leaking. Problem solved! Violet takes a picture of the fixed pipe and it’s added to her user record so the next time she calls, Ursa Major will have that history.

    Visual Remote Assistant allows Ursa Major to resolve issues the first time around. If more help is needed, agents or technicians can add a subject matter expert to the session.

    If they can’t solve the problem right away, the agent or technician can figure out the next steps. Next steps include things like ordering parts, walking the customer through installing the new parts, or scheduling an onsite service call.

    Let’s watch a company resolving a customer problem using Visual Remote Assistant.

    Sita understands the value that Visual Remote Assistant can bring to Ursa Major Solar. She’s happy to see that it allows Ursa Major a way to deliver exceptional service from anywhere. Then the team can give the customer real-time visual feedback to diagnose and even fix problems without going onsite. She’s excited to use Visual Remote Assistant at Ursa Major.

    Set Up Visual Remote Assistant
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List the prerequisites for using Visual Remote Assistant.
        Install the Visual Remote Assistant managed package.
        Train agents and field service technicians to work with customers using Visual Remote Assistant.

    Are You Ready?

     Ursa Major’s admin, Maria, makes sure that she has everything set up to use Visual Remote Assistant. She runs through the list of prerequisites.

        Service Cloud or Field Service licenses. Ursa Major uses Field Service, so it’s already enabled, customized, and the permissions are set up.
        Lightning Experience. Ursa Major uses Lightning Experience, too, so that’s ready.
        Licenses for Visual Remote Assistant. Sita worked with her Salesforce Account Executive to purchase the necessary licenses.
        The correct permission sets.

    Maria has everything she needs. She’s ready to get started.
    Install the Managed Package

    Maria is ready to install the Visual Remote Assistant managed package. For a business org, you may want to install new packages in a sandbox org first to test them but here we install directly into your Trailhead playground.

    Note

     We assume you're a Visual Remote Assistant administrator with the proper permissions and licenses to install and use the managed package. If that's not the case, that’s OK. Read along to learn how your administrator would take the steps in a production org. Don't try to follow these steps in your Trailhead Playground. Visual Remote Assistant isn't available in the Trailhead Playground.

        Open an incognito browser window in Chrome.
        In the incognito window, paste this link http://sfdc.co/visualremoteassistant-install into the address bar.
        On the Salesforce login screen, enter the username and password for your org, then click Log In.
        Enter the verification code from your email.
        Select Install for Admins Only, select the acknowledgment, then click Install.
        Approve the request to grant access to third-party websites.
        Wait for a message telling you that you’ll be notified by email when the package is installed, and click Done.
        Check your email for notification that the package installed.

    It can take a few minutes, but when the installation is complete, check out what you’ve installed. In the App Launcher, search for visual.

    App Launcher displaying selections for Visual Remote Assistant, Visual Remote Assistant - API Details, Account Details and more.

    Maria selects Visual Remote Assistant to see more.
    Train Employees

    Ada and James work together to develop a training program for agents and technicians. Ada is responsible for the agent perspective and James focuses on how technicians use Visual Remote Assistant.

    They create a list of common scenarios that can benefit from a visual connection to the customer. The list includes basic in-home repairs. Here’s part of Ursa Major’s list of tasks that customers can perform. It’s not a full list, but it gives you a sense of Ursa Major’s goals.

        Examine hot water heaters leaking inside the house for loose connections or defective parts.
        If solar panels on the ground are losing efficiency, visually inspect them for loose debris.
        Check to make sure that all connections are securely fastened.
        Use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert barcodes, QR codes, and more into text to look up panel warranty, item number, and more.

    Then they create a list of common scenarios where a visit must be scheduled. For example, some tasks are too dangerous for a customer to attempt. Instead, a knowledgeable technician must come onsite to fix the problem. Ursa Major never compromises on customer safety.

        Don’t attempt to fix problems with electrical components that could shock or injure the customer.
        Don’t have customers climb onto their roof or go to any area that’s dangerous to access.
        Don’t disassemble complex components that require a delicate touch or specialized expertise.

    Finally, they list the tasks that agents and technicians must perform to use Visual Remote Assistant.

        Decide if it’s a case for Visual Remote Assistant.
        Locate and start Visual Remote Assistant.
        Walk customers through connecting their mobile device.
        Take pictures to include in the record or forward to a subject matter expert.
        Use augmented reality to add information to a customer’s phone display, like arrows or circles.
        Know when to add a subject matter expert to the agent’s ongoing session.
        Know when to schedule a follow-up appointment.

    Now that Ada and James have the training information, they decide to create a Sales Enablement badge to train their team members. After a team member completes the badge, they shadow a trained team member for a day to see Visual Remote Assistant in action. After that, they’re ready to start helping customers in a whole new way.

    Learn the Foundations of Carbon Accounting
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:  

        Explain the basic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting principles.
        Describe the different objects that work to create a carbon accounting framework. 

    Before We Start

    If you completed the Net Zero Cloud Basics module, then you already know how Northern Trail Outfitters uses Net Zero Cloud to support and scope their climate strategy. Not to mention Net Zero Cloud Admin Essentials module which outlined how an admin can set up and configure the application. If you haven’t completed these modules, we recommend taking them to have more context as you dive into carbon accounting.
    Account for Your Actions

    The world is in a climate crisis and the need to reduce carbon emissions has never been more urgent. Regulators, investors, and customers are urging companies to get to net zero faster. Companies are faced with the challenge of tracking the complete spectrum of their value chain emissions, which can be a complex and cumbersome process. In this module, we’ll look at how Net Zero Cloud can help you meet that challenge. 

    Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) is using Salesforce’s Net Zero Cloud to collect, analyze, and report energy usage data and track their carbon footprint. As a part of its net zero commitment, NTO plans to track its carbon footprint and set long-term goals to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    How Net Zero Cloud Can Help

    Today, companies are generally expected to gather data on their emissions-producing activities, calculate, and report their contribution to atmospheric emissions, and reduce emissions across all three scopes. Check out this help topic to see examples of how emissions are qualified as scope 1, 2, and 3. Net Zero Cloud makes this entire carbon accounting process easy and streamlined for a company like NTO. Net Zero Cloud provides the tools to quantify and measure carbon emissions, and helps companies make informed decisions about which mitigation strategies will be most effective.

    In Net Zero Cloud, all emissions are converted to their carbon dioxide equivalents and are reported in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). Wondering what tCO₂e means? tCO₂e is a standardized unit for counting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, regardless of whether they're from carbon dioxide or another gas, such as methane, nitrous oxide, or one of the dozens of refrigerants used throughout the world today.

    Net Zero Cloud helps companies create an annual emissions inventory. A GHG inventory is the basis for efforts to reduce emissions and their associated environmental impacts. Once you know what your emissions are, it’s easier to tackle the process of reducing the impact of these emissions. An accurate GHG inventory also helps companies forecast emissions in future years.

    Calculating GHG emissions also enables companies like NTO to set science-based emissions reduction targets. An accurate GHG inventory is the required starting point for determining which targets should be set and for determining how to quantify these targets.

    Let’s follow along as Sam Rajan, the Chief Sustainability Officer at NTO, explores carbon accounting using Net Zero Cloud for all stationary and vehicle asset sources.

    Sam Rajan, the Chief Sustainability Officer at NTO.
    Explore the Building Blocks of Carbon Accounting

    There are four key building blocks in Net Zero Cloud that help users manage the carbon accounting process.

        Emissions Sources: Emissions sources represent the assets of an enterprise that generate carbon emissions. The three types of emissions sources in Net Zero Cloud are:

            Stationary Asset Environmental Sources: Assets that are stationary in nature, such as office buildings, data centers, or warehouses.
            Vehicle Asset Emissions Sources: Assets that are mobile in nature, such as company vehicles or private jets.
            Scope 3 Emissions Sources: Scope 3 activities that are the source of emissions, such as transportation, purchase of raw materials, hotel stays, and so on. This category of emissions results from the activities of the company that are from sources not owned or controlled by the company.

        Energy Use Records: Energy use records are created for a specific date or date range and are associated with an emissions source. Examples include monthly electricity consumption for a stationary asset or a single commercial flight record. Users can enter energy consumption information, such as the quantity of electricity, diesel, or natural gas consumed, over a specific period of time in various units of measure that are specific to the activity or fuel being consumed. Based on the emissions factors referenced by the energy use record, Net Zero Cloud does the work for you by converting the entered consumption into carbon emissions.
        Emissions Factors: Emissions factors are used to convert energy consumption into GHG emissions. Several emissions factors in the form of reference datasets from standard government or private sources are preconfigured in Net Zero Cloud. Examples include the eGRID dataset for electricity subgrid emissions in the United States and the EEIO datasets that estimate tCO2e per monetary output across most of the 8 upstream scope 3 categories. Emissions factors specific to a region, business sector, or country can also be added to Net Zero Cloud.
        Carbon Footprints: A carbon footprint is an estimate of the amount of CO2e released to the environment during the lifecycle of a product or an activity. Carbon footprints primarily exist to summarize values from multiple energy use records. There are three types of carbon footprints in Net Zero Cloud, corresponding to the three types of emissions sources.

            Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions by scope, summarized from underlying energy uses for a stationary asset across all fuel types. Net Zero Cloud automatically creates Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Item records to show summarized emissions information for a single fuel type.
            Vehicle Asset Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions by scope, summarized from underlying energy uses for a vehicular asset.
            Scope 3 Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions from underlying energy uses for a scope 3 activity. While you can associate a Scope 3 Emissions Source to the carbon footprint record, you can also associate a stationary source. For example, a warehouse can be the epicenter of scope 3 activities such as purchase of goods and services, transportation and distribution, and waste generation. You can associate the required energy use records and procurement summary records to determine from which activities you want to calculate emissions. 

    Now that Sam understands the building blocks for carbon accounting, he maps out the connections between these objects.

    Track Emissions for Stationary Assets
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List the key fields on a stationary asset environmental source record.
        Explain how to specify values for key fields on stationary asset energy use records.
        Show a simple calculation of emissions on a stationary asset energy use record. 

    Take Stock of Your Buildings

    Stationary asset environmental sources are used to represent all buildings and data centers associated with a company. Let’s look at how Sam handles this for NTO. Since all of NTO’s stationary asset records come with a few key fields, Sam creates a record for the NTO Headquarters and reviews and populates the key fields.

    A stationary asset environmental source record showing details for NTO Headquarters Miami.

    Let’s take a deeper dive into these fields and what they represent.

    Field
    	

    Description
    	

    Impact on Calculations

    Carbon Emissions Scope Allocation
    	

    The object that specifies the GHG Protocol scope of emissions for different fuels. Each fuel type has its own scope allocation record in the Carbon Emissions Scope Allocation Values object.
    	

    This field helps the user specify the scope to which the emissions from each fuel is allocated.

    Refrigerant Emissions Factor
    	

    The object that holds the global warming potential (GWP) for cooling refrigerants, such as CFCs, HFCs, and HCFCs used in stationary asset sources. You can create one record per refrigerant type.
    	

    To properly calculate tCO₂e from refrigerant leakage, the refrigerant’s GWP is multiplied by the quantity of refrigerant leakage.

    Electricity Emissions Factor Set
    	

    The object that holds a range of information that's relevant to calculating the scope 2 emissions generated from electricity. The GHG Protocol provides two methods for tracking scope 2 emissions: the market-based method and the location-based method. There are fields specific to both of these methods in the electricity emissions factor set.
    	

    Yearly datasets from sources such as Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) website can be uploaded to accurately calculate electricity-based emissions in a specific postal code.

    Other Emissions Factor Set
    	

    The object that holds predefined emissions and conversion factors for emissions resulting from use of natural gas, propane, and on-site diesel use. While in the other emissions factor record, you can define the global warming potential values for CH₄ and N₂O, in the associated other emissions factor set item records, you can specify values for different fuel types, such as gasoline, LPG, or biodiesel.
    	

    All individual emissions and conversion factors for sources that are not included in the electricity grid or scope 3 data types are captured as part of the Other Emissions Factors.

    Regional Building Energy Intensity
    	

    Lookup to a building energy intensity record from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data. The CBECS is a national sample survey that collects energy usage information on commercial buildings across the USA. The energy usage data serves as a reliable and publicly available standard, and is preloaded in Net Zero Cloud. The value is automatically populated when the country is the United States, the postal code is valid, and the total floor area is populated in the record.
    	

    NTO can use the CBECS building energy intensity data to plug energy use gaps in the data of commercial buildings (more on this later).
    Energy Use for Stationary Assets

    Buildings and warehouses at NTO use electricity, diesel for backup generators, and refrigerants for cooling. Each of these require separate energy use records associated with the same stationary asset source. 

    Within energy use records, Net Zero Cloud automatically calculates many of the fields based on energy use data and emissions factors.

    Three energy use records associated with a stationary asset environmental source record.
    Data for Key Fields

    Sam works to create the energy use records to allow for emissions calculations. He looks at the information within an energy use record, one section at a time.

    General Information

    On a stationary asset’s energy use record, information like the total and occupied floor area and whether the asset is company-owned helps with calculations. Sam can also specify the stationary asset for which energy consumption is being recorded, the start and end dates of the energy consumption, and the corresponding stationary asset carbon footprint record.

    General information, such as building details, reporting period, and references to the associated asset and carbon footprint on a stationary asset energy use record.

    Consumption

    Depending on the type of fuel for which an energy use record is created, this section helps Sam define the following.

        Fuel type: There are multiple fuel types for which you can enter energy consumption, including Electricity, Diesel, Natural Gas, and Propane.
        Fuel consumption unit: Multiple units of measure are supported natively in Net Zero Cloud corresponding to the different fuel types that are supported. 

    Fuel consumption information on a stationary asset energy use record.

    Emissions Factors 

    If the emissions factors are specified on the stationary asset environmental source, they are automatically inherited by the associated energy use records. Thanks to the flexibility of Net Zero Cloud, Sam can also override the values on each energy use record if he needs to.

    Associated emissions factors for electricity, fuel, and refrigerants on a stationary asset energy use record.

    Supplemental Emissions

    Sam can also specify supplemental emissions for each scope to manually adjust emissions, if needed. These are used in the calculated total emissions.

    Supplemental emissions information on a stationary asset energy use record.

    Grid Mix

    The grid mix values on the energy use record are calculated based on the grid mix percentages specified in the associated electricity emissions factor set record. If he needs to, Sam can override the values for location-based and market-based grid mix on an electricity emissions factor set record based on the information he gets from the suppliers for NTO’s buildings in a specific postal code.

        The market-based grid mix depends on the electricity that organizations have chosen to purchase from specific suppliers and takes supplier-specific emissions rates into consideration.
        The location-based grid mix depends on the emissions intensity of the local grid area where the electricity usage occurs. 

    Location-based and market-based grid mix information on a stationary asset energy use record.

    Renewable Energy

    Renewable energy displays the quantity of electricity that’s generated from renewable sources. Sam can specifically allocate electricity generated from renewable sources in the Renewable Energy Type and Allocated Renewable Energy fields. The basis for the renewable energy calculations is the allocated renewable energy value entered on the energy use record and the market-based grid mix percentage on the electricity emissions factors record.

    Emissions

    This section displays the autocalculated emissions in tCO₂e by scope corresponding to the entered energy consumption in the stationary asset energy use record.

    A Few Calculations Explained

    Now that Sam has explored the key information on an energy use record for a stationary asset, he tries to understand how the emissions are calculated. Sam creates the following energy use records for the NTO Office Headquarters Miami stationary asset environmental source record.

    Calculation of Electricity Related Emissions

    The United States - US-TX - electricityMap 2019 emissions factor record specifies the following.

        CO₂e Emissions Rate for Location Based Emissions Factors = 396.78 g/kWh
        Location-Based Coal-Mix Percentage: 20%
        Location-Based Gas-Mix Percentage: 47%
        Location-Based Nuclear-Mix Percentage: 11% 

    Emissions factor details on an electricity emissions factor set record.

    Let’s see how the energy values are calculated on the stationary asset energy use record Monthly Electricity Bill Jan.

    Scope 2 Location-Based Emissions (tCO₂e) = Electricity consumption (in kWh) * Emissions factor (g/kWh) / 10^6 (tCO₂e conversion factor) 

                                                                           = 1000*396.78/1000000 = 0.3968 tCO₂e

    Furthermore, here’s how the information is calculated for the Location-Based Grid Mix.

        Location-Based Electricity from Coal (kWh): 20% of 1000 kWh = 200 kWh
        Location-Based Electricity from Gas (kWh): 47% of 1000 kWh = 470 kWh
        Location-Based Electricity from Nuclear (kWh): 11% of 1000 kWh = 110 kWh 

    Greenhouse gas emissions results and grid mix data on a stationary asset energy use record for electricity.

    A similar approach is followed to calculate market-based electricity emissions by referring to the market-based grid mix percentages.

    Calculation of Diesel Related Emissions

    The Fuel Conversion Factors - DEFRA EPA 2018 factor set record specifies the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values.

        GWP of CH₄: 28
        GWP of N₂O: 265 

    The OEFSI-0000006 factor set item record specifies the following.

    Fuel Type
    	

    Calorific Value
    	

    Supplied tCO₂e Emissions Factor
    	

    CH₄ Emissions Factor
    	

    CO₂ Emissions Factor
    	

    N₂O Emissions Factor

    Diesel
    	

    15 kWh/L
    	

    12.45 tonnes/mWh
    	

    3.00
    	

    73.96
    	

    0.06

    The consumption of diesel (1000 Liters) is first converted to its kWh equivalent using its calorific value, which is 15 kWh/L. 

    Total Fuel Consumption = 15000 kWh (1000*15)

    Next, this value is multiplied by the Supplied tCO₂e emissions factor and divided by the conversion factor.

    Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = Supplied tCO₂e Emissions Factor * Total Fuel Consumption/1000 

                                                   = (12.45*15000/1000) = 186.75

    The autocalculated Scope 1 Emissions (tCO2e) value for Diesel on a stationary asset energy use record.

    Calculation of Refrigerant Related Emissions

    Lastly, let’s check out how emissions are calculated when the fuel type is Refrigerant. The Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) - IPCC AR4 2007 refrigerant emissions factor record specifies the Global Warming Potential as 22,800.

    Here’s how the emissions calculation shapes up.

    Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = GWP * Fuel Consumption(kg)/1000 

                                                 = 22,800*10/1000 = 228

    Greenhouse gas emission results on a stationary asset energy use record for Refrigerant.

    In the next unit, Sam creates a carbon footprint for this stationary asset and learns more about the calculations. Let’s follow along with him.

    Manage Carbon Footprint Records for Stationary Assets
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List the key fields on stationary asset carbon footprint records.
        Explain how scope allocation is determined for various fuel sources.
        Describe how emissions are calculated for a data center. 

    Introduction to Carbon Footprints

    Sam is making great progress! He defined emissions sources and energy uses for stationary assets and looked at how emissions are calculated in the Net Zero Cloud app. Now he concentrates on rolling up the emissions data to a carbon footprint record. Sam can attach multiple stationary asset energy use records to a stationary asset carbon footprint record to get a single calculated carbon footprint for an asset.

    While a stationary asset carbon footprint shows the tCO₂e emissions for an asset, its child records, Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Items, show the tCO₂e emissions for individual fuel types. So, if Sam creates a carbon footprint record to calculate the total tCO₂e emissions for the NTO Headquarters for 2021, he can also have carbon footprint items that show emissions separately from, say, electricity, natural gas, and diesel.

    Note that while Sam can manually create carbon footprint records and associate them with energy use records, the application can also do this for him. If a carbon footprint record exists for a given period, all new energy use records falling within that period get automatically associated with this carbon footprint record. If Sam creates a new energy use record and it covers a time period for which a carbon footprint record does not yet exist, Net Zero Cloud automatically creates a new carbon footprint and associates the energy record with it. This saves Sam a lot of time.

    Note

    Only the energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are automatically rolled up into the carbon footprint record that he creates. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to get View All or Modify All permission for the required records.

    When Sam attaches energy use records to a carbon footprint record, the scope 1, 2, and 3 calculations of the energy use records automatically sum to a total value shown in the carbon footprint record. Just like for individual energy use records, Sam can also manually specify supplemental emissions by scope on all carbon footprint record types.
    Stationary Asset Carbon Footprints

    The following key data points are available on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

    General Information

    Sam can specify the Stationary Asset Environment Source to which this footprint is associated, the reporting period of the carbon footprint, the stage of the footprint in the overall lifecycle, the previous year’s annual carbon footprint record, and the audit approval status. Sam can also select the allocation status for renewable energy used in the asset source.

    Building Details

    Sam can specify the building energy intensity lookup and the regional building energy intensity lookup that can be used to resolve gaps in the energy consumption data for a commercial building stationary asset (more on this in the next unit). 

    If the Stationary Asset Environmental Source record for this footprint is already associated with a Regional Building Energy Intensity record, then the same Regional Building Energy Intensity record is automatically populated in the Carbon Footprint record. However, Sam needs to identify the Building Energy Intensity record that is most applicable to the building’s carbon footprint and select that record. 

    Building Details section on a Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint record.

    Greenhouse Gas Emissions

    Sam can see the autocalculated values for Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2 Market-Based, Total Scope 2 Location-Based, Total Scope 3 Upstream, and Total Scope 3 Downstream Emissions (tCO₂e) for the associated source. The values are derived by summing up values from the underlying energy use records.

    Greenhouse gas emissions results on a stationary asset Carbon footprint record.

    Total Energy Use Summaries

    Total Energy Consumption for the stationary asset source is calculated in kilowatt-hours, megawatt-hours, and gigajoules. Sam can also see the Total Building Indirect Energy Consumption (MWh), which is the consumption of energy specifically from electricity, heat, cooling, and steam, and excludes emissions from other fuels.

    Total energy use summaries on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

    Renewable Energy Details

    Based on the allocation status of the carbon footprint, Sam can see the Total Renewable Energy generated, both in absolute kWh and as a percentage of the overall electricity consumed. Also, he can see allocated renewable energy expressed in kWh, which is the renewable energy explicitly defined in energy use records. Sam can refer to these values to check the proportion of renewable or “cleaner” sources of energy used for each asset. This positions him better to meet his goal of increasing the allocated renewable energy percentage. 

    Renewable energy details on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

    Grid Mix Information

    Sam can see the rolled up values from all electricity energy use records for both location-based and market-based grid mix data for the asset source. And just like for energy use records, the data is categorized by fuel sources, such as biomass, coal, solar, wind, and oil. This makes it easy for Sam to see the big picture but also hone in on the fuel source components and how they each play a role.

    Location-based and market-based grid mix data on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

    Energy Use Intensity Comparisons

    Sam can see the total regional electricity consumption intensity and the percentage difference between the regional intensity and the intensity of the associated carbon footprint item for electricity consumption. Sam can use this information to understand how far off a particular stationary asset is from the average electricity consumption in that region. If the variance is too high, maybe it’s time to make the building more energy-efficient.

    Energy use intensity comparisons on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

    Data Quality Metrics

    Sam can view the average monthly electricity consumption and the energy consumption intensities for the current and previous years, calculated both in square meters and square feet. Another handy value is to check the maximum variance above and below the average expressed as a percentage. This is super useful for Sam to understand the role seasonality plays and to identify any data abnormalities.

    Data quality metrics on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.
    Footprint Items

    The Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Items for a Carbon Footprint contain data for an individual fuel type. Let’s take the example from the previous unit to see a snapshot of how data rolls up in Net Zero Cloud.

    Three carbon footprint items, each for a different fuel type, associated with a parent carbon footprint for a stationary asset.

    Here’s a way to see how carbon footprint items roll up data based on fuel type, and how carbon footprints roll up data based on consolidated energy consumption across all fuel types.

    The following key information can be found on a stationary asset carbon footprint item record.

        Total Emissions (tCO₂e) from the fuel type.
        Total Energy Consumption of the Fuel Type, expressed in kWh equivalent, even if the underlying fuel is not electricity.
        Energy Consumption Intensity of the Fuel Type for the current and previous years. 

    Intensity metrics on a stationary asset carbon footprint item record, where fuel type is electricity.
    What’s the Scope?

    For each energy consumption record entered, there is a default scope against which the emissions are recorded based on the fuel type and asset ownership. The asset ownership is determined by the Company-Owned Asset checkbox on an asset’s record. The associated energy use records inherit this status from the asset, but it can also be overridden.

    To understand the default scope allocation performed by Net Zero Cloud for various fuel types and for assets owned and leased by the reporting company, check out Stationary Asset Energy Use. 

    There are typical allocations based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, but exceptions occur frequently in the world of carbon accounting. There can be instances where Sam needs to change the default scope allocation for a specific asset source. For example, NTO might own the building, and therefore consider most fuels to be scope 1, while leasing equipment and considering emissions from that equipment to be scope 3. These determinations are often made with the help of experienced consultants.

    The default scope allocations in Net Zero Cloud can be overridden through the Scope Allocation capability, where Sam can assign the scope into which a particular fuel type’s emissions must be aggregated. To do this, he creates a new carbon emissions scope allocation record, manually sets each individual fuel’s allocation to a scope in the child records, and then assigns the new carbon emissions scope allocation record to his asset. By using Scope Allocation, Net Zero Cloud users have ultimate flexibility in how they account for their GHG emissions.

    Data Centers as Asset Sources

    NTO, being a retail company, doesn’t operate any data centers. But there are companies who do, and they must define their data centers as stationary asset environmental sources. The reason that data centers are considered a special case in Net Zero Cloud is because of the way total electricity usage in the facility is estimated from known electricity consumption of the IT equipment. 

    A Salesforce admin can configure the record type for the asset and information can be captured for data centers, similar to commercial buildings. While most calculations are similar for emissions, there are two major differences.

        If the fuel type on a stationary asset energy use record is Electricity for a data center asset source, the user must specify a value for the field Power Usage Effectiveness. Generally a value between 1 and 2, this is the ratio of the total amount of energy used by a data center to the energy delivered to just the computing equipment. The calculated emissions are scaled up by this value to calculate tCO₂e for electricity. For other fuel types, there are no changes to calculated emissions.
        The Power Usage Effectiveness field on a stationary asset energy use record for a data center.
        Therefore, for data center assets, Total Fuel Consumption (kWh) = Fuel Consumption (kWh) * Power Usage Effectiveness
        In the other emissions factor set, there’s a provision to show the Data Center Refrigerant Leakage Rate value expressed in kg/IT kWh, which specifies the leakage rate of the refrigerant used for cooling the data center's computing equipment.

    Sam has explored carbon accounting for stationary assets and learned about the calculations. In the next unit, let’s follow along as Sam uses Net Zero Cloud to fill gaps in the carbon footprint data.

    Benchmark Building Energy Intensity and Fill Gaps in the Carbon Footprint Data
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List the possible data gaps in a carbon footprint record.
        Explain building benchmarks.
        List the steps to fill gaps in a carbon footprint record. 

    No Data, No Worries!

    NTO has many buildings across the globe. The company uses several energy sources to heat and cool the buildings, and power gadgets and devices. As we saw in the earlier unit, Net Zero Cloud uses energy use records to calculate the carbon footprint. Sam uses the monthly utility bills to obtain the energy consumption data for these assets, which he then feeds into Net Zero Cloud as energy use records. 

    But there’s a problem. Electricity bills for a couple of months for a few of NTO’s buildings aren’t available. And there’s no way for Sam to know the total energy usage for these months. 

    Any gaps in the energy use data can cause inaccurate carbon footprint accounting, which can lead to incorrect annual emissions inventories. We can’t stress enough the need for reliable and auditable carbon inventories for accurate sustainability impact reporting. 

    Here’s a list of situations that can cause gaps in the energy use data. 

        Missing energy consumption data: The monthly energy consumption bills are missing or the data is unavailable for some reason.
        Orphan energy use records: Energy use records that share the reporting year and organization asset with a carbon footprint (CF) record but aren’t linked to the CF record yet.
        Date issues: Two or more energy use records cover the same reporting period but have issues with dates. For example, missing start or end dates, start or end dates being out of range over the same reporting period, or overlapping start and end dates. 

    So what should Sam do? Fortunately, Net Zero Cloud provides a quick and easy way to intelligently identify gaps in the carbon footprint data and fill them. Sam can use industry benchmarks or create custom benchmarks.

    Note

    Data gap filling is available only for stationary assets with the Commercial Building record type. As part of the initial configuration for stationary assets, the Salesforce admin creates the Commercial Building record type. (To learn more about the admin setup, see the Net Zero Cloud Admin Essentials Trailhead module.)
    Benchmark Your Building Energy Usage

    Net Zero Cloud supports the use of the following benchmarking approaches to fill in the missing energy use data. 

    Use Industry Benchmark 

    The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) is a national sample survey that researches and collects energy-related building characteristics and energy usage data of U.S. commercial buildings. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes CBECS results.

    For reference data, the Salesforce admin loads the CBECS industry benchmark data into Regional Building Energy Intensity data records.

    Create and Use Your Own Benchmark

    Sam can use BEI Builder in Net Zero Cloud to compute a benchmark and develop insights into the average energy usage across all NTO buildings. Sam can then use the benchmark for filling in the gaps for buildings with missing energy use data. These numbers are stored in Building Energy Intensity (BEI) data records. BEI is measured in kWh/sqft or kWh/m² per year.
    Create a Building Energy Intensity Record Using BEI Builder

    BEI Builder guides Sam through the process of creating BEI records for NTO’s commercial buildings. It calculates the benchmark by averaging energy consumption values from existing energy use records. 

     

    Note

    Only energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are automatically pulled into the BEI record that Sam creates. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to get View All or Modify All permission for all the required records.

    Energy use records that meet certain filter criteria are considered for BEI calculation. Let’s go over these criteria.

    Averaging Window Start Date and Averaging Window End Date

    Energy use records must belong to the period defined by these dates. 

    Building Size Category 

    Energy use records must be for assets whose total floor area falls in the range defined by the building size category record. For more information, see Create a Building Size Category record.

     

    Note

    BEI Builder uses the occupied floor area of buildings to calculate the BEI to ensure that usage is estimated for the occupied space in which the energy was consumed. 

    The floor area values are retrieved from the corresponding stationary asset environmental source record for the asset.

     

    Building Asset Type

    The buildings must be of the asset type defined by Building Asset Type. Asset types can be Office, Restaurant, or Hotel.

    Note

    Ensure that the record type for the asset is mapped with the stationary asset type - Commercial Building.

    GeographicalArea

    The buildings must be from the business region or country defined by Geographical Area.

    Energy consumption of buildings can vary depending on the climate and other external factors that are specific to a geographical area. Hence, geographical area information plays a key role in creating a distinct benchmark that’s used for data gap filling.

    If Sam wants to include energy use records that are created during the data gap filling process, he can select the System Generated Energy Use Records Included checkbox.

    On clicking Create, the Calculate Building Energy Intensity data processing job runs in the backend to calculate BEI and create a record. The Salesforce admin has already activated this data processing engine job template. For more information about BEI calculations, see Building Energy Intensity Calculations.
    Using CBECS vs BEI

    Whether you use the industry benchmark (CBECS) data or your own benchmark for filling data gaps depends on your organization’s requirements and preferences. For example, organizations can choose CBECS for buildings in the USA as it’s reliable and has been validated by government agencies. If CBECS data isn’t available for a certain fuel type or region, or the organization wants to use its own benchmark, you’d go with BEI.

    Let’s follow along as Sam uses Net Zero Cloud to identify and fill data gaps in one of the CF records.
    Fill Data Gaps in Carbon Accounting with Net Zero Cloud

    To get started, Sam selects Fill Data Gaps from the action menu of a carbon footprint record, which launches a wizard. Data gap filling in Net Zero Cloud is a three-step process.

     

    Step 1. Associate the orphan energy use records with the carbon footprint record.

    The first page lists energy use records that match the reporting year and organization asset of the CF record but aren’t yet associated with this or any other CF record. 

     

    Sam reviews the list, selects the ones that must be associated with the CF record, and clicks Save. The selected records get associated with the CF record and are removed from the list.

    Note

    Only the energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are displayed in the list.

    Sam clicks Next to move to the next step. 

    Step 2. Fix energy use report dates.

    The next page lists energy use records that are associated with the CF record but have issues with dates. 

     

    By default, the list shows all such records but Sam can choose to view records with specific issues only. For example, to view records with missing dates, Sam keeps only the Missing dates checkbox selected and clicks Search to refresh the list. 

    Sam fixes the dates and clicks Save, and then clicks Next to move to the final step.

    Step 3. For fuel types with missing energy use data, create and associate energy use records.

    Steps 1 and 2 helped Sam identify and associate unassociated energy use records with the CF record, and correct date issues in associated energy use records. The final step is to fill the data gaps.

    Sam must select the fuel type for which he wants to fill the data gaps, and the fill method. He selects Cooling for the fuel type and Regional Building Energy Intensity for the fill method. The page shows record entries for the period with missing data and suggested values in the Fill Data (kWh) column. 

     

    In the case of Regional Building Energy Intensity fill method, Net Zero Cloud uses the intensity value from the preloaded CBECS data.

    This fill method is available only if a Regional BEI record is associated with the CF record (Regional Building Energy Intensity field).

    Record entries on the page provide details of the energy use records that will be automatically created. Sam selects the desired entries per fuel type and saves the changes before clicking Finish. 

    The corresponding energy use records are created. Sam notices that the System Generated Record checkbox in the Data Gap Filling Audit Information section of each of these records is selected. 

     

    Likewise, Sam reviews, identifies, and fixes data gaps and inconsistencies in other CF records. 

    Let’s see how Net Zero Cloud calculates the suggested values when we select other fill methods. 

    Building Energy Intensity: Net Zero Cloud uses the intensity value that Sam created using BEI Builder.

    This method is available only if a BEI record is associated with the CF record (Building Energy Intensity field). 

    Previous Year Daily Average: Net Zero Cloud computes and uses the average daily energy consumption data from the previous year. This method is available only if the previous year’s CF record is associated with the Previous Year Annual Carbon Footprint field in the CF record, and if at least one energy use record for the selected fuel type exists. 

     

    Current Year Daily Average: Net Zero Cloud computes and uses the average daily energy consumption data from the current year. This method is available only if at least one energy use record for the selected fuel type exists.

    Manual: Sam must enter the energy use data for filling the gap manually. 

     

    Sam is now ready to see how carbon accounting works for vehicle assets. Let’s find out in the next unit.

    Track Carbon Emissions for Vehicle Asset Sources
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List the key fields on vehicle asset records.
        List the key fields on vehicle asset energy use records.
        Explain how to calculate emissions from vehicle assets. 

    NTO’s Vehicle Assets

    NTO has two key vehicle emissions sources to account for: the private jets that NTO operates and the shuttle cars that are used for employee commuting. Sam creates a company-owned asset for a private jet used by the CEO of the company, and a record for the company shuttle in the Miami region, which they lease from a local car rental company for employee commutes. 

    While most fields remain similar for the vehicle emissions sources, Sam takes a look at the key fields that impact emissions calculations.

        Vehicle type: Based on the record types configured by the admin, you can select the type of vehicle for which you want to calculate emissions. NTO can select between Fleet Vehicles and Private Jets.
        Other emissions factors: Lookup to the object that holds reference data for emissions from various fuel sources. Other emissions factor item records associated with the parent other emissions factor set record contains emissions factors for different fuel types, such as jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, or CNG. 

    Apart from these key fields, Sam can also add additional information, such as the scope allocation, lease ID, lease expiration date, vehicle ID, and business region on a vehicle asset emissions source record.

    A Vehicle Asset Emissions Source record showing details of NTO Miami Company Shuttle.
    Energy Use Records for Vehicle Assets

    Let’s turn our attention to energy use. Now that he’s recorded his vehicle assets, Sam can specify supplier-provided fuel consumption data. Here are the details that Sam can specify on the energy use record.

        Fuel consumption details: Depending on the type of asset, fuel type can either be jet fuel for private jets, or any other fuel for fleet vehicles, such as biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel, or gasoline. Sam can also specify fuel consumption values in liters or gallons from gas station bills and fuel refill receipts.
        Distance: This is the distance traveled by a company car or the private jet for the reporting period. Distance can be specified in kilometers or miles.
        Aircraft details: Sam can specify the type of aircraft, which impacts the fuel efficiency and consumption patterns. From the flight receipts, Sam can also specify the flight duration and flight date. 

    The following attributes are auto calculated based on the values provided and the data that is in an emissions factor record linked to.

        Fuel Efficiency
        CH₄, CO₂, and N₂O Emissions (kg)
        Scope-Based Emissions (tCO₂e)
        Total Fuel Consumption in US Gallons and Liters
        Aircraft Fuel Economy (Gallons per Hour) 

    User-specified and autocalculated fields on a vehicle asset energy use record.
    Vehicle Asset Carbon Footprint

    Now it’s time for Sam to create a carbon footprint record for each vehicle asset that he’d specified earlier to calculate the total carbon emissions from a vehicle represented in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). The conversion factors from the associated Other Emissions Factors and related Other Emissions Factor Items are used to calculate the emissions.

    The following key data points are available on a vehicle asset carbon footprint record.

        Total fuel use: Sam can view the total fuel usage for a vehicle in gallons and in liters. The values are rolled up from the associated energy use records for the vehicle.
        Supplemental emissions: Sam can also specify supplemental emissions by scope to manually adjust emissions, if needed. These are added to the calculated total emissions.
        Greenhouse gas emissions: Sam can see the auto calculated values for Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2 Market-Based, Total Scope 2 Location-Based, Total Scope 3 Upstream and Total Scope 3 Downstream Emissions (tCO₂e) for the associated source.

    Calculations for Vehicle Emissions

    The following information is available on a vehicle asset energy use record for a fleet vehicle asset source such as NTO’s company shuttle.

    Field
    	

    Value

    Name
    	

    Miami Shuttle Fueling Receipt 2/3/21

    Reporting Period
    	

    2/3/2021 - 2/3/2021

    Distance
    	

    100 miles

    Fuel Type
    	

    Diesel

    Fuel Consumption
    	

    100 liters

    The data inputs on a vehicle asset energy use record.

    First, Net Zero Cloud converts the fuel consumption to gallons. 100 liters = 26.42 gallons.

    Next, let’s look at the information in the  other emissions factor set record. The fuel conversion factors - DEFRA EPA 2018 record has an associated other emissions factor item record that holds the emissions factors for Diesel. The values are as follows.

    Field
    	

     Value

    CO₂ Emissions Factor
    	

    9.75 g/US gal

    N₂O Emissions Factor
    	

    0.3 g/US gal

    CH₄ Emissions Factor
    	

    0.12 g/US gal

    So, for 26.4 gallons of Diesel, the mass of CO₂, N₂O, and CH₄ generated is calculated by applying the emissions factors.

        CO2: 26.42*9.75*0.001 = 0.257568 kg
        N20: 26.4*0.3*0.001 = 0.007925 kg
        CH4: 26.4*0.12*0.001 = 0.003170 kg 

    Note that the contribution of N₂O and CH₄ emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents is not 1:1. This equivalence is obtained from the global warming potential (GWP) values referred to in the other emissions factors record.

        N₂O GWP = 265
        CH₄ GWP = 28 

    Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = {CO₂ Emissions (Kg) /1000} + {N₂O Emissions (Kg) /1000 *N₂O GWP} + {CH₄ Emissions (Kg)/1000 * CH₄ GWP}

                                                 = {0.257568/1000} + {0.007925/1000*265} + {0.003170/1000*28} = 0.0024

    A vehicle asset energy use record showing the calculated scope 1 emissions for a vehicle which uses diesel.

    Similar calculations are carried out for private jets by referring to the fuel conversion factors for jet fuel and other values, such as aircraft fuel economy.
    What’s Next?

    Let’s pause for a moment to understand what Sam has done so far. He has listed the stationary and vehicle asset sources for NTO’s carbon accounting process and he has decoded the various emissions factors used for estimation of tCO₂e emissions for these assets. Next, he has created energy use records for stationary and vehicle assets, and he created the required carbon footprint records to aggregate the data. Sam has also looked at the calculations behind the scenes. He is now ready to uncover a few extra details about the carbon accounting process in the next unit.

    Explore Additional Features for Carbon Accounting
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List the stages of carbon footprints.
        Explain record locking and carbon footprint recalculation.
        Explain why you need an annual carbon inventory record. 

    Carbon Footprint Stages

    A carbon footprint record is flexible in Net Zero Cloud. Companies can choose the reporting period for carbon footprints and how granular they want footprints to be. For example, Sam has the flexibility to create carbon footprint records that summarize emissions for a single asset for a given year, or for multiple assets across any period. NTO has chosen to create carbon footprints for each stationary and vehicle asset source for a single year.

    Sam notices that on all carbon footprint records there’s a field called the Footprint Stage. Carbon footprints for NTO go through a detailed process of approval and audit. All data is validated within Sam’s team and calculations are completed. Then, both internal and external audits are conducted to ensure that all emissions are correctly accounted for.

    Net Zero Cloud makes this process easy to manage. The Footprint Stage field comes with logical values that help Sam move the record through each stage with a simple click! Let’s take a closer look at these values and what they mean.

    Note

    The following picklist values are available by default for the Footprint Stage field on a carbon footprint record in Net Zero Cloud, but your admin can customize the stages as per company requirements.

        Emissions source confirmation: The user confirms whether to include an individual building or vehicle asset in the carbon footprint.
        Data collection: All energy consumption records are entered and associated with the assets.
        Validation: The user determines that the initial data looks correct, including the input and the calculated emissions output based on the associated emissions factors.
        Renewable energy allocation: The renewable energy allocation information is added to the energy consumption records.
        Internal audit: An internal auditor validates the energy consumption and carbon footprint information.
        External audit: An external auditor validates the carbon footprint information.
        Completed: The validated carbon footprint record is marked as complete. 

    The Footprint Stage picklist on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

    The best part is that Sam can easily manage multiple carbon footprint records through their lifecycle using the Kanban view. This view makes the workflow better because Sam can visually track where each record is in the footprinting process. And when one stage is complete, he simply drags the record and drops it to the column of the next stage!

    Do More with Carbon Footprints

    The flexibility doesn’t end there. Sam explores a few additional features that make carbon accounting even easier with Net Zero Cloud.

    Lock the Carbon Footprint Record

    To ensure that the carbon footprint record is not updated accidentally or by an automated process, Sam locks the carbon footprint record, which also locks the child, or associated, energy use records. This prevents the carbon footprint record and all the energy use records associated with it from being recalculated. It also prevents accidental updates to the records during audits. Locked carbon footprint records can be unlocked later.

    The Record Locked checkbox on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

    Recalculate the Carbon Footprint

    The carbon footprint record can become out of sync with the energy use records that are associated with it, such as when emissions factors change or when the energy consumption numbers are updated in a child energy use record. If the emissions factors have changed for any associated energy use records, Sam can click Recalculate on a carbon footprint to reset and recalculate values from all attached energy use records. When a child energy use record is added or updated, Net Zero Cloud automatically recalculates all the child energy use records and the carbon footprint record. No manual updating and tracking needed!

    Note

    Sam can modify, lock, unlock, and recalculate carbon footprint records that he created. But if he wants to perform these actions on records that are created by other users, he must have Modify All permission on them. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to gain the required permissions.
    Why Do You Need a Carbon Inventory?

    Sam now understands all the essentials of carbon accounting. Since all the work’s done and it’s the end of the year, Sam wants to give himself a pat on the back and a well-deserved break. But before that, he notices that there’s one last item left to be ticked off his to-do list. Sam can create an annual emissions inventory record for any given year to roll up all carbon footprints for all sources and activities. The aim for NTO is to set a science-based target and develop an emissions reduction target in line with Science-Based Targets Initiative’s (SBTi) criteria. The carbon inventory is the first step towards getting started on that path.

    On an annual emissions inventory record, Sam can see granular information for each emissions source type, broken up by category and activity and even the percentage of each emissions type towards the total emissions. Emissions from a Carbon Footprint record are aggregated into the annual emissions inventory if they meet the following conditions:

        The Reporting Year on a footprint record matches the Year that is selected during inventory creation.
        The Footprint Stage on a footprint record matches the Carbon Footprint Stage that is selected during inventory creation.
        The Annual Emissions Inventory on a footprint record is associated with an inventory record. 

    An annual emissions inventory record for 2021 showing total emissions by scope.

    Previously, Sam would have had to do all these calculations manually. That could have taken months! Salesforce Net Zero Cloud enables easy recording and traceability of calculated emissions. Moreover, Sam can also use this data to further forecast NTO’s emissions for upcoming years accurately. Sam can truly have a restful time-off!
    Sum It Up

    Salesforce Net Zero Cloud solves many of the issues with traditional carbon accounting: incomplete or missing records, manual data tracking in multiple spreadsheets, and unstructured data. The time it took NTO to collect, calculate, and audit data has been reduced from months to weeks.

    With all the data flowing directly onto one platform, Sam can efficiently quantify the carbon footprint across scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and reduce NTO’s carbon footprint, getting them closer to their net zero goal. Following in his footsteps, you too can formulate a climate action plan from a single source of truth, and easily measure and manage your plans with your trusted partner, the Net Zero Cloud.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain what digital engagement is.
        Describe key benefits of digital customer service.
        Identify the differences between digital service and digital transformation.

    What Is Digital Engagement?

    Ursa Major Solar’s business continues to grow. The company can’t keep enough solar panels in stock to sell to all its customers—and potential customers—who keep trying to contact them. But contacting Ursa Major Solar is difficult. At least that’s what Sita Nagappan-Alvarez, the CEO of Ursa Major Solar, keeps hearing. After a large deal closed with a residential builder, the client said, “If I could’ve reached you or learned about your business sooner, I would’ve bought twice as many panels...”

    Salesforce Research states, "As customers spend more time at home with their devices and less time in stores or places of work, the shift toward digital channels has accelerated. At the same time, the share of organizations offering in-person customer service plummeted, and channels such as online chat, messenger apps, and video support saw double-digit adoption gains. Eighty-seven percent of service professionals say customers have increased their use of digital channels during the pandemic." Gone are the days when an email or phone call is enough. To keep customers and potential customers happy, you must engage with them in the digital realm.

    Enter, digital engagement. It’s a term that describes how companies engage with customers across all digital touchpoints, while providing a consistent customer experience. Typically, a customer’s journey includes marketing, selling, and servicing in a way that lets them switch between multiple channels without interrupting a positive experience.

    Four concentric circles intersecting, representing Marketing Cloud Engagement, Sales Cloud, Commerce Cloud, and Service Cloud

    A typical digital customer journey for Ursa Major Solar might look like this:

        A new campaign to promote solar panels on the web or on multiple social media channels (Marketing Cloud Engagement).
        Leads and opportunities from the campaign are captured and every stage of the deal is tracked and analyzed until the sale of the solar panel is complete (Sales Cloud & Commerce Cloud).
        After the solar panel is purchased, customers receive service reminders as texts on their mobile devices, review service agreements from a website, and reach out to support via chatbots, web chat, social media channels, and more (Service Cloud).

    Each part of the journey—no matter where the customer is at—is optimized with automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to make sure that a positive experience is delivered consistently.
    Digital Transformation

    Sita knows that emerging technology is transforming customers’ expectations. Customers ask virtual assistants to play their morning playlist, use applications to order their favorite foods, call for a ride, or navigate traffic. The reason these experiences are sticky is that emerging technologies like AI are embedded into these apps to power customer experiences. To stay competitive, companies need to incorporate digital technologies into their customer experiences.

    Customers expect to interact with businesses the same way they do in their personal lives—on mobile devices, with SMS messaging, social media, and more. If customers aren’t receiving the experiences they expect, they can easily take their business elsewhere. The rise of social media and review websites give customers more of a voice. In the past, customers might have shared a bad experience with friends and family, but with social media, they can broadcast bad experiences with the world.

    Digital transformation—converting ink-on-paper records to digital formats—encourages businesses to reconsider how to deliver customer experiences, and question traditional ideas of teams and departments. That doesn’t mean support agents need to run marketing campaigns, but it can mean knocking down walls between departments. A social media presence can encompass marketing, selling, and servicing, tied together by a digital platform that captures customer information, creates personalized journeys, and routes questions from customers or potential customers to the right support agents.
    Benefits of Digital Service

    Sita knows that digital transformation has reshaped how companies approach customer service. The old model was to wait for customers to find you, whether in person or by calling a toll-free number. But the rise of digital communication has changed service much like it’s changed advertising, media, and news.

    The practice of providing excellent service hasn’t changed. But the process of answering a question, looking up relevant data, and offering a solution has become much more efficient with mobile devices and multiple communication channels. Sita can see that embracing social media, automation, and AI will help build better relationships with new and existing customers.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain how Service Cloud helps with digital engagement.
        Describe key digital engagement options with Service Cloud.

    How Service Cloud Helps with Digital Engagement

    Even though each digital engagement journey for a customer includes marketing, selling, and servicing, Sita focuses on service. Based on the stats and feedback she’s received, transforming service for Ursa Major Solar is her number one priority.

    Tip: This module focuses on digital engagement for Service Cloud. To learn more about the other clouds, see:

    To get started with digital engagement for service, Sita turns to her rock star admin, Maria Jimenez. Maria has set up several Salesforce features for Ursa Major Solar, and she’s ready to share how Service Cloud can help with digital engagement.

     

    Sita and Maria standing alongside the Ursa Major Solar logo.

    First, since Salesforce is already in use, a number of digital engagement tools are available to set up. Maria may need to purchase a few new user or feature licenses, but everything she needs to help Ursa Major Solar engage and support customers in the digital realm is a few clicks away.

    Service Area
    	

    Description

    Service Cloud Platform
    	

        Provide a 360-degree view of customers and their past preferences from multiple channels. The platform includes agent productivity tools and routing features so customer cases automatically go to the right agent, at the right time, from anywhere, on any device.
        Push agents relevant knowledge from across your organization, including key articles, topics, and advice from your product experts.
        Allow agents to see customers’ histories to check on service agreements and to offer personalized incentives and special offers.

    Service Cloud Messaging
    	

        Let your company have conversations with customers in ways that are most convenient for them—on their mobile devices using messaging apps, such as SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger.
        Power conversations with chatbots to automate service or agents can connect instantly with a customer to give them the personalized help they might need.

    Service Cloud Embedded Service for Web or Mobile Apps
    	

        Embed customer service directly into your web pages and mobile apps so you can reach customers right where they are.
        Let your customers contact you on the go without interrupting their browsing experience or mobile experience.
        Add chat, knowledge, and case capabilities to your websites and mobile apps to provide richer service.

    Salesforce Self-Service
    	

        Build branded sites that let customers help themselves, anytime, on any device, without the assistance of an agent.
        Add self-service web portals to help customers connect with each other for insights, access knowledge, and interact with chatbots to find the right resources or get redirected to the right agent for immediate service.

    Service Cloud Einstein
    	

        Put artificial intelligence (AI) into routine service interactions, especially for chatbots on digital channels like web chat, SMS messaging, or voice activated devices.
        Connect chatbots to existing business process for more intelligent service automation.
        Save agents time by using machine learning to surface the best responses and knowledge from past cases and conversations. Let Einstein analyze incoming cases to automatically predict fields so that the right agents can handle specific requests faster.


    Sita is impressed with Service Cloud’s areas to support the digital realm. But she wonders where email and phone fits in. “Aren’t email and phones digital?” Maria assures her that email and telephone are traditional channels for service that often fall into the realm of digital engagement. Both email and telephony are part of multichannel service available with Service Cloud.
    Digital Engagement Options with Service Cloud

    Maria dives a little deeper into specific Service Cloud features and how they help with customer engagement. Learning about these features will help Sita and the service team decide what to implement.

    Service Area
    	

    Description

    Service Console
    	

        The Service Console is a centralized interface that lets agents see all relevant information about customers and helps them respond to cases across multiple channels, simultaneously.
        The console integrates with productivity tools, routing mechanisms, useful knowledge, predictive intelligence, data from other systems, and more to provide a unified workspace to support customers on any device, from any location, across any channel.
        All service features and channels connect with the console. And, since the console is a Lightning app, it’s easy to customize and scale with components and drag-and-drop tools.

    Salesforce Mobile app
    	

        Salesforce Mobile app is for customer service on the go, and it’s available on both iOS and Android devices.
        The app gives you real-time access to the same case and customer information that you see on the console but is organized for getting work done from your mobile device.

    Omni-Channel
    	

        Omni-Channel routes any type of incoming work item to the most qualified, available support agents in the console. Monitor agent workloads and the status of work items routed by Omni-Channel.
        Agents can raise flags on work items when they need assistance from a supervisor, and supervisors can monitor conversations between agents and customers, and send helpful messages that only the agent sees.
        Supervisors can also respond to incoming support requests by changing queues as needed and can update agent skills quickly.

    Voice & Call Center
    	

        Voice & Call Center integrates phone call capabilities with the console so that you can use your computer as a phone. Whenever a customer calls, their information appears front and center for agents so that they have everything they need to help the customer.
        No more time spent searching, scrolling, or clicking for information about a customer. Make outgoing calls directly from the console, and report on call outcome, duration, and more.

    Email-to-Case
    	

        Email-to-Case automatically converts emails sent to an address you specify to cases in the console.
        Email exchanges between customers and agents are tracked to see history and sentiment and lead to the quickest resolution.

    Web-to-Case
    	

        Web-to-Case lets you add a submission form on your website so that customers can submit cases directly to the console for agents.
        Since you choose the case fields on the form, any workflows, assignments, and responses are automatically triggered.

    Experience Cloud Sites
    	

        Sites help you share information and collaborate with customers, partners, or employees. Whether you call it a self-service web portal, a help forum, a support site, or something else, an online community lets your agents share approved content and connect with others from the console.
        Use easy point-and-click tools with Lightning templates to create branded collaboration spaces for various business purposes.

    Messaging
    	

        Messaging lets customers start conversations with your company by sending texts to your designated phone number or sending Facebook Messenger messages to your Facebook page. Incoming messages are displayed in the console, where agents can accept messages and start chatting.
        Agents can also proactively reach out to customers on these channels to keep them updated or use automation to send customers messages when Salesforce records change, such as when cases are closed.

    Embedded Service
    	

        Embedded Service helps you add personalized service to connected apps for mobile and the web. Create and monitor cases from any mobile device for a seamless service experience wherever your customers are located.
        Set up two-way audio chat for devices so that agents can have context for issues and solve problems directly from the console.

    Einstein Bots
    	

        Einstein Bots are applications that simulate human conversation, either aloud or from text message. Instead of having a conversation with an agent, customers can have a conversation with a computer integrated with an AI technology called Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
        Whether through typing or talking, a chatbot can connect with a customer to answer routine questions, leaving agents more time to help customers with more complex questions or problems.

    Einstein Case Classification
    	

        Einstein Case Classification uses predictive intelligence on new cases to recommend or populate picklist and checkbox field values based on past data. It uses machine learning, AI technology that determines the values on case fields, to free up time for support agents.
        More time for support agents means more time spent making customers happy and delivering exceptional experiences.

    Plan for Digital Engagement
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Learn the importance of implementing case management before digital engagement.
        Begin the planning process for Service Cloud’s digital engagement tools.
        Understand the importance of content for digital engagement.

    Prepare for Digital Service

    Maria knows that adding multiple channels is the second stage of the general setup process for Service Cloud. (See the Service Cloud for Lightning Experience module for a refresher.)

    Service Cloud’s implementation process represented by concentric circles with an arrow pointed at the second circle, which is Channels.

    Maria understands why she shouldn’t set up channels or digital engagement first: If a customer reaches out for help, but there’s no consistent way to track, route, or respond to their question, who would receive the case to resolve? A customer or agent lost in an unclear case management process makes for an unhappy customer and agent.

    Maria is excited about setting up digital engagement features for service. Before she sets up any features, she asks Ursa Major Solar’s service team some questions about how they work. She wants a thousand-foot view into their general processes and requirements before she implements any specific features.

    Fundamentals

    Question
    	

    Answer

    Do your agents have a complete view of the customer?
    	

    Yes, during our case management implementation, we customized a Service Console to show account, contact, and other records for 360-degree views of customers. The console is ready to support multiple channels.

    Are you able to effectively route cases or messaging sessions to the right agents?
    	

    Yes, during our case management implementation, we set up some queues, assignment rules, and escalation rules, but we need to look into Omni-Channel.

    Omni-Channel routing sounds more robust and can automatically push and prioritize a variety of work to agents, without them picking items from a queue or determining priorities. We definitely need Omni-Channel for better automation and to scale the growth of our service team.

    Are you using automation to save time and speed case resolution?
    	

    We’re using some of the basic assignment and escalation rules.

    However, we’re not using anything like automated conversations with chatbots to answer routine questions online. We’re also not using any kind of AI or machine learning to make automatic field predictions to speed up case resolution. Someone needs to look into self-service, Einstein Bots, and Einstein Case Classification.

    Do your agents spend a significant amount of time switching between applications to get customer information or answers?
    	

    The console has made it easier for agents to see complete views of customers, but we need to do something about knowledge.

    We implemented Salesforce Knowledge, but we need to add the Knowledge component to the console so that automation suggests correct answers to agents while they’re working on cases.

    Self-Service

    Question
    	

    Answer

    Where can customers find answers to questions about your products or services? Can they access answers and information on a website or a mobile app?
    	

    Currently, we have a Web-to-Case form on our website where customers can submit cases. But that’s it. We’ve been wanting to update our website for a while, but we haven’t made the time.

    After reading about Experience Cloud sites, we need something like that online where customers, agents, and experts can collaborate and share ideas. We also need a source of truth for some documents about our solar panels. And adding a chatbot on an Experience Cloud site to answer common questions would help unload some of the most tedious work from our agents.

    Information for customers on a mobile app sounds great, but we need a site first, which everyone can access on mobile devices.

    Is there a business process—like registering a solar panel—that requires your customers to call an agent? Is there data that can only be accessed over the phone? How can you make this easier to access?
    	

    Unfortunately, to register solar panels, customers have to call an agent. Clearly, we need a web presence like an Experience Cloud site where customers can register any of our products online and do so at their own convenience.

    Also, since we implemented Salesforce Knowledge, we need to share some of our articles online so that customers can troubleshoot routine issues themselves, 24/7, without having to phone an agent during business hours.

    If you already have a knowledge base for your customers, are you using marketing automation to increase engagement and adoption of the portal?
    	

    Once we have a self-service site, and set up some social media channels, we will definitely look into message automation to drive traffic and awareness to it. Thank goodness we already have Salesforce Knowledge with some incredibly helpful articles that are ready to share online!

    	
    	

    Social Presence

    Question
    	

    Answer

    Do you receive service-related questions on social media? Are the right people responding?
    	

    We don’t know. We have no social media presence right now, at least none we’re participating in or responding to. We have to add a variety of social media channels to our digital engagement plans—we have to reach customers where they are at.

    Are customers chatting online about themes related to your product or industry?
    	

    Ryan De Lyon, our customer service manager, has heard some customers are posting questions about our solar panels on Twitter and Facebook. Since we are not monitoring those channels, we don’t really know what is going on there or how our brand is affected.

    Ideally, once we set up social channels, we’d like to contribute to conversations about the solar panel industry and lead a few talking points to build new relationships and drive more business.

    Are your customers already building online forums of their own to discuss your products or services?
    	

    We don’t know—we need to research this topic. A few months ago, one of our agents mentioned that there was a website displaying some of our solar panel manuals with a few comments posted on the site, but we’re not sure what that is about. Sounds like we need to look into it immediately.

    Messaging

    Question
    	

    Answer

    Where does most of your customer traffic come from? Is it from mobile or desktop?
    	

    We don’t know. We think that most of the people we interact with have mobile phones and use text messaging. Once we have some of our digital channels up and running, like self-service sites or social media, we should post a survey to our customers and try to determine how many of them prefer communicating with us from mobile devices or desktops.

    Do you know your percentage of customers using iPhones versus Android?
    	

    No, this is another area for a customer survey once we have digital channels set up. The answer will help us learn on which devices to build mobile service apps in the future.

    Are your customers using international messaging apps like WeChat or WhatsApp?
    	

    Currently, we don’t have any international customers. In the future, however, we hope to expand globally, so this question is important for us as we plan for growth.

    	
    	

    Automation & AI

    Question
    	

    Answer

    Do your agents spend time on data entry or repeating steps on every case that they work?
    	

    Our agents do type a lot of the same things in the console, but we’re already looking into the console’s Macros and Quick Text features to reduce repetitive tasks.

    Macros will help agents select email templates, send emails, and change case statuses all with one click, whereas Quick Text will help agents send a variety of predefined messages to customers so they save time typing the same responses, no matter which channel.

    Do you have a list of the top common questions, such as order status or password reset that you get from customers on a regular basis?
    	

    Yes, our agents spend a lot of time answering similar questions, especially on order statuses. If we had a self-service site or a text messaging channel where Einstein Bots could answer those questions, our agents could focus on solving more complex issues that require creativity and teamwork.

    Do you have any picklist or checkbox fields on cases that machine learning could prefill for agents; any recommendations for knowledge articles or next actions for agents?
    	

    Yes, some useful fields to predict are Case Reason, Escalated, and Priority—having those automatically predicted would save agents time and clicks. And, anytime a useful article from our knowledge base could surface to an agent without searching for it is a productivity boost. Also, any kind of AI that suggests next-best actions for agents while they work would be a dream come true. Offloading some decisions during customer interactions could only help agents focus on building better relationships.
    Digital Content Considerations

    As Maria plans for digital engagement, she sees a unique thread that ties a number of features together—content. She wonders, “Do we have the right content ready to help agents and customers across multiple channels?” Based on the answers to the planning questions above, she knows the answer is no.

    Traditionally, content is something only marketers, advertisers, or media agencies created. Support agents worked with a limited content choice of case open or case closed. If service teams created content, it was usually a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page on a website. With chatbots, SMS messaging, social media posts, or conversational interfaces from buttons all the way to online payments, content is a big piece of how to deliver service. Content is also a critical component for closing the loop on marketing, selling, and servicing. Content creation and curation requires a new set of skills for service. The teams at Ursa Major Solar will have to give considerable thought to the content that appears in each stage of a basic digital customer journey.
    Next Steps for Digital Engagement

    Now that Sita and Maria have answers to their questions, they take a step back to prioritize Service Cloud feature implementations. There are a lot of features they can set up, so they ask themselves a few more high-level questions.

        Which channel should we set up first, second, and so on?
        Are our agents trained to communicate on those channels?
        Will agents cover all channels or will some agents cover specific channels?
        Will the channel take into account international customers and multiple languages?
        Are our console and case management processes ready to support each new channel and automation or AI?

    All of these questions should be asked before adding a new digital channel to a multichannel support model. Once Maria gets the answers she’s looking for, she can begin setting up specific service features for Ursa Major Solar. It looks like there’s a lot more Trailhead in Maria’s future.

        Define Web3.
        Describe each evolution of the internet.
        Describe why Web3 is important for the future.

    Welcome to the World Wide Web

    A lot has changed since the advent of the internet in the early 1990s... The internet is alive. It’s an ever-changing technology that has become our default context. And as the internet has evolved—from a way to link documents to an accessible information system to an interconnected social network with millions of active users daily—the way we relate to each other and the world around us has changed. 

    Since its advent, the internet has enabled billions of users worldwide to learn, share, and connect globally for free. But millions of people can share and manipulate all of the information out there. This creates the enormous gaps in transparency, privacy, and security we experience with today’s internet ecosystem. This problem can theoretically be solved with the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0, often referred to as Web3. 

    How we connect with our friends, family, and coworkers has drastically shifted since the early ’90s, taking us from in-person to virtual, making the digital world more central to our everyday lives. We’re now seeing a new digital economy emerging with users at the center. Many believe we’re entering the next era, where the emerging technology and use cases we see today will continue to evolve and be played out over years and decades.

    There’s a lot to unpack here. That’s why we created this module: to help make sense of where we’ve been, where we’re headed next, and what it all means.

    Before we get to the details about Web3, let’s review some basics. Let’s start from the beginning. 
    The Evolution of the Internet

    The evolution of the web is often divided into three stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0. 

    In the beginning, Web1 (1990 to 2000) democratized access to information. It was the first iteration of the world wide web. Most of us were consumers of content. And the creators were typically developers who built websites that contained information mainly in text or image format. Data and content were served from a static file system rather than a database, and sites didn’t have much interactivity at all. It was the Web of Read.

    Most of us have experienced the wonders of the web in its current form, which is referred to as Web2 (2000 to 2021). This stage of the internet took Web1 further by democratizing connections and transactions. In this era, the simplicity built into the interfaces and applications enabled anyone to become a creator. It’s the Web of Read and Write.

    As we experience the beginning of the Web3 era (2021 and beyond), applications will not run on a single server or store data in a single database owned by central authorities. Instead, Web3 applications will either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer-to-peer servers (nodes), or a combination of the two. Web3 has the potential to democratize participation on the internet, enabling people to Read, Write, and Own both their data and digital identity.

    Why Web3 Matters

    Web3 is a point of evolution beyond where we have been operating. It’s an extension of Web2, which incorporates the advanced technologies we see coming to fruition today. The idea of Web3 is not only to fuel the formation of the metaverse and expansion of cryptocurrency, but to touch on other major industries in our globally interconnected world. The ultimate goal of Web3 is to create a more connected and open digital world.

    Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities will not decide who uses what services. Nor is there a need for an intermediary to facilitate virtual transactions between parties. Web3 theoretically better protects user privacy in certain ways because it’s these authorities and go-betweens in Web2 doing most of the data collection. 

    There are a number of advantages that Web3 has the potential to offer.

        Decentralization: Intermediaries would be removed from the equation, and blockchains would provide a transparent platform where the rules are unbreakable and data is publicly recorded.
        Ownership of data: End users will regain control of data by creating a public record of all their activity on the blockchain. Information could then be shared on a case-by-case and permissioned basis.
        Potential for reduction in hacks and data breaches: As more businesses and enterprises enter the space, there will be a large need for added security. This new technology can provide enhanced security because data will be decentralized and distributed. With further development of the rules and regulations, there is potential for reduction in large-scale hacks and data breaches where hackers would need to turn off the entire network of servers and record every transaction on the blockchain to access information.
        Permissionless blockchains: Anyone could create an address and interact with the network. Users will not be barred on account of geography, income, gender, orientation, or a host of other sociological and demographic factors.

    While still in its early years, the mission behind Web3 is to create a decentralized web that creates new types of ownership, new ways of building trust and collaboration, and opens the doors to new possibilities. It has the potential to change how we interact with the web in the upcoming decades. Web3 is built on blockchain technology that validates user data, creates transaction transparency, and provides more secure payment options. 
    Where Do We Go Next?

    The future is a decentralized, global marketplace. In the next unit, discover how Web3 is transforming industries and impacting businesses, society, and individuals alike.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe main components of Web3.
        Define NFT, blockchain, and cryptocurrency.

    The Building Blocks of Web3: Blockchain

    In today’s digital-first world, someone can buy a tweet, develop digital land, pay without a traditional currency, and track down data to the 1s and 0s, all from the comfort of their personal device. The innovative technology that enables this transparency is the blockchain. 

    A blockchain is a system of recording information on a tamper-resistant digital ledger distributed across its entire network of computer systems. Each block on the chain contains transaction data that records each transaction on participants’ ledgers. The transactions are public and cannot be changed, tampered with, or erased once published. 

    The idea of a blockchain came to life as a solution for accurate and fixed time stamps, similar to that of a notary. This fundamental aspect is still present in technology today. 

    Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), where these transactions are programmable, immutable, and anonymous. 

    Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that is programmable, anonymous, unanimous, distributed, immutable, and traceable.

    Blockchains are constantly growing as blocks (transactions recording verified information) are added to the chain through every transaction. This increases the security of the entire ledger. The more blocks on the chain, the more secure the entire system becomes. This also allows regulators to easily identify if one of the blocks was tampered with, making hacking nearly impossible. 

    This is a young sector, and norms and standards are still emerging, including key issues such as sustainability. Companies, including Salesforce, have an opportunity to lead with values, and shape positive norms and benchmarks for using NFT and blockchain technology sustainably.

    One key challenge in this space is related to sustainability. Many of the first generation cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin) rely on proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, which require the use of energy (that is, work) to perform transactions. This has resulted in significant energy consumption and carbon emissions, with Bitcoin consuming as much power per year as the country of Thailand (as of February 2022), according to the Digiconomist.

    The industry is continuing to address sustainability issues as their technology evolves, as we’re seeing with new and upcoming proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Based on current models, it’s believed that PoS blockchains drastically reduce the energy consumption seen by current-state PoW blockchains (by as much as 99.95% according to Olga Kharif’s Bye-Bye, Miners! How Ethereum’s Big Change Will Work, which appeared on Bloomberg.com in 2021). Additionally, e-waste from PoW blockchain use may be eliminated by switching to PoS, which does not rely on physical hardware for securing the network.

    Companies and organizations exploring blockchain applications should put in place clear sustainability strategies to quantify, minimize, neutralize, and disclose environmental impacts resulting in net zero emissions while driving increased sustainability in the sector more broadly.

    Now that we’ve discussed the power, purpose, and impact of Web3, let’s look at how this technology is utilized in cryptocurrencies. 
    What Makes a Currency a Cryptocurrency?

    The simple answer is that a cryptocurrency is a nontraditional digital currency built on the blockchain. To expand on this, let’s look at how cryptocurrencies came to be. 

    On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto sent a paper to a group of cryptographers familiar with blockchain technology outlining a new form of “electronic cash” called Bitcoin. In this paper he outlined how the distributed ledger technology (DLT) was combined with several other technologies and concepts to create the cryptocurrencies of today. These digital currencies are essentially electronic cash protected through cryptographic mechanisms instead of a central authority like a bank, company, or government. 

    Blockchain technology is the foundation of modern cryptocurrencies, most commonly referred to as crypto. They got their name because of the heavy usage of cryptographic functions paired with the decentralized ledgers. 

    This system allows someone to purchase, trade, and own a variety of things, including NFTs and real estate. And with more integration into our financial system, many more applications can be expected. 

    Next, let’s explore the role of NFTs in the Web3 ecosystem. 
    What Is an NFT?

    An NFT (nonfungible token) is a digital asset that represents either digital or physical objects like art, music, event tickets, videos, and more. They’re backed by smart contracts, which allows them to have distinctive properties such as secondary sales and transferable value. 

    Here’s how NFTs work.

        NFTs exist on a blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger that records transactions.
        NFTs are blockchain agnostic, meaning they can be built on a variety of blockchains.
        An NFT is created, or “minted” from digital objects that can represent both tangible and intangible items.
        An NFT can have only one owner at a time, and an NFT’s unique data makes it easy to verify the creator and owner, and enables token transfer between owners.
        The creator writes a smart contract that defines the use and royalties of the NFT.

    The Value of NFTs

    So why buy an NFT, since anyone can copy an image or a video with an internet search and a few clicks? Well, buying an NFT gives proof of ownership of a unique digital asset, which can include virtual goods, in-game items, digital art, and more. Because they are built on the blockchain, the transaction and ownership history is public. This information is validated and records authenticity of the seller and the sole ownership. Just like with a physical asset, this can be collected, traded, or sold. In the case of digital art or when purchasing NFTs in secondary marketplaces, buyers should follow best practices to avoid potential scams and other risks. (More on this in a later unit.)

    This technology enables trust and transparency between the buyer and seller by having full access to the historical transactions. The transparency provided by the public records can give the buyer insight into the seller's transaction history. As this technology develops, we’ll see companies creating products that will verify a seller or provide a risk rating based on past digital interactions. 

    Anyone can search online and find an image, video, or NFT for that matter, and download it to a device. But that’s just saving a copy of the file, not obtaining rights to the digital ownership of the file. For example, there are a lot of copies of Van Gogh’s Starry Night painting, but there’s only one original Starry Night. In theory, NFTs offer collectors the ability to own the digital rights to a piece of art, similar to owning the original Starry Night. (Note: This does not account for creators who copy and repost the original artist’s work as their own. These artists are infringing on copyright and can face serious penalties.)

    Brand-new experiences are being built around rare digital and physical goods through the use of NFTs. Given that any digital thing can be an NFT, there are several possible use cases. Some companies have already capitalized on this idea, doing things such as launching an NFT system to verify the authenticity of sneakers, or creating NFTs from video clips of landmark sports moments so fans can own the best plays.

    To demonstrate NFTs’ utility, here are a few more use cases. We may continue to see more as time and technology progress.

        Gaming asset: NFTs can be used as characters in video games and possess gamification capabilities. For example, games have allowed players to purchase NFTs that serve as their game avatars. And as players play, they can earn more NFTs, such as an ultra-rare shield to help them in battle or a new accessory to deck out their avatar.
        Key: NFTs can act as key to unlocking content, like a subscription to a sports or news magazine. Only the holders of the NFT are able to access the articles, updates, and statistics in the publication.
        Digital twin: NFTs can be purely digital; however, some projects have allowed the creation of digital twins. This can be something like offering virtual clothes that can be worn in the metaverse or sending an identical physical object to NFT owners.
        IP ownership: Projects can allow members to own the intellectual property of their NFT. The owner doesn't have to ask the NFT creator to use their avatar—they have the ability to create an entire business around the NFT.
        Governance/voting: NFTs can give owners voting rights on upcoming promotional merchandise and new platform/product releases, among other things.

    NFTs can create authenticity, establish value, democratize access to global markets, and build community. Let’s take a deeper look at how NFTs use smart contracts and wallets. 
    Smart Contracts and Wallets

    How does someone actually use cryptocurrency to buy an NFT? Let’s start by understanding how these transactions are tracked with smart contracts and how users employ wallets to buy and hold onto their NFTs.

    First let’s go over a few NFT-related terms. 

    Smart contracts: These are simply computer programs (a few lines of code), stored on a blockchain, that run when predetermined conditions are met. They can be viewed as an application of Web3. They’re typically used to automate the execution of an agreement (or contract), so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action, when certain conditions are met.

    Wallets: A wallet is an app (or plugin), which enables users to access/retrieve, send, and receive digital assets. When a user acquires cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, they can store it in a wallet and from there use it to make transactions. There are two types of wallets.

        A custodial wallet is one created and secured by someone other than the true owner—for example, an account set up on Coinbase.
        A noncustodial wallet is one consumers create, own, and manage themselves. They often live directly within browsers (hot) or on offline devices (cold storage). Users self-manage security.

    Smart contracts are used to protect buyers and sellers with automated contracts that are programmed to execute when certain conditions are met. These agreements can’t be changed or disputed once executed because smart contracts are immutable, distributed, and public. 

    With the ability to track when and to whom all NFTs are sold, smart contracts make purchasing NFTs at scale possible. This creates many possibilities, like enabling royalties for the original creator of an NFT, and offering protection for buyers.

    To actually purchase an NFT, a buyer needs a wallet. There are many kinds of wallets, both custodial and noncustodial, each with pros and cons. Metamask, for example, is a noncustodial, browser-based wallet that’s currently the most popular to use with OpenSea, a popular NFT marketplace. With the rising popularity of NFTs and marketplaces, buyers should look into which wallet fits their needs best for security, ease of use, and compatibility with their marketplace of choice. 

    Wallets enable new capabilities for brands and users to interact. A few new possibilities include: 

        New identity: Users may connect to a site and then provide access to any relevant information they want to share with the company for personalization. This provides a key to access the data, rather than sharing it.
        New experiences: In the near future, users may be able to have a wide range of assets in their wallets, essentially creating virtual versions of themselves. These 3D representations will allow them to try clothes on in real time and see the fit on their virtual selves.
        New ways to sign in: In the future, users may use NFTs on sites rather than passwords. Held in wallets, the NFTs will grant access without the need to remember passwords or have personal information stored in a brand’s network.

    Now that you’ve learned about blockchain, crypto, and NFTs, let’s explore how all of these technologies can come together in the metaverse to create distinct digital experiences made possible through the engagement and participation of the evolving Web3 community.

    Build Community in Web3
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe and define the metaverse.
        Describe main components of the Web3 community.
        Explain the utility of DAOs and dApps in building community

    Where Worlds Collide: The Metaverse

    As we’ve discussed, we’re in the early days of a new version of the internet called Web3. It’s being built on trusted, decentralized technology accessible to all. Platforms, apps, and data won't belong to large platforms—they’ll belong to users. 

    Some people are calling this new internet the metaverse. The metaverse is a new reality that reimagines how we interact with the world around us. Playing Fortnite or roaming around Roblox are great examples of Web2 metaverses, the difference is that the Web3 metaverse is backed by the chain. 

    The terms metaverse and Web3 have been used interchangeably, but they have inherent differences. According to Oxford Languages, the metaverse is “a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.” Users will only be able to jump between digital worlds with ownership of their assets intact if the metaverse is operating on a decentralized platform. 

    Web3 enables a more equitable metaverse, allowing for true ownership (and interoperability) across many metaverses/gamescapes and virtual realities. For example, a sword bought for one game could now be used in another.

    The metaverse is where the Web3 community comes together to connect, learn, game, and engage with people around the world. 
    Community Comes First

    Community and collaboration is central to Web3, providing a foundation that improves the likelihood of success and maintains relevance of a project, idea, event, and so forth. 

    The strength of an online community’s network is not only determined by how many people make up the community, but also the participants’ engagement on social media and community discussion forums. The decentralized nature of blockchain emphasizes the importance of community as a pillar of the next generation of internet. 

    So where are these communities if everything is decentralized? The short answer is, they’re everywhere around the world. They’re communicating via messaging platforms and social media, and organizing live events to attend together. Having tremendous reach and engagement across Discord, Twitter, and Telegram, these communities of diverse individuals are able to have a real impact. Since the foundation of these communities are messaging based, users are more engaged with content on the platform and have deeper connection to the people and content. They’re participants rather than simply users.

    One way communities come together in Web3 is through DAOs and dApps. Keep reading to learn about these two functions of Web3. 
    Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

    A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a group or collective made up of individuals who organize around a common purpose. They’re managed by smart contracts, powered by tokens, have a shared treasury, and are governed by community voting. Examples range from the development of open-source software to a crowd-sourced attempt at purchasing the US Constitution. 

    DAOs are to Web3 what open-source projects are to Web1. DAOs are made up of people who share common goals and objectives, visions, and values. These groups unite to produce products or deliver services, and members/contributors are rewarded for their contributions to the collective.

    DAOs represent a framework for community and shared responsibility—what companies represent in the context of Web2. This framework might very well function as the underpinning for the future of work (the next era of the gig economy).
    Decentralized Apps (dApps)

    Next, we have decentralized apps (dApps), which are applications (software), built on a decentralized network (blockchain), which combine a smart contract and a front-end (UI). dApps use the same front end as Web2 apps, but rely on blockchain technology rather than centralized servers or other centralized databases. 

    Web2 applications like Instagram or Twitter differ from Web3 applications in that they’re owned/operated by centralized authorities (for example, companies like Meta). 

    In the case of Web3 applications, no central authority or governing body has absolute control or governance rights when it comes to data recorded on/by the network. Instead, the data is verified by a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers.

    In the future, we can expect that media, gaming, and finance industries will see a significant shift toward dApps, as they provide greater ownership for creators, enable play-to-earn, and create faster and more secure transactions.
    Bringing It All Together

    Each of these technologies—blockchain, cryptocurrencies, metaverses, DAOs, dApps—are paving the way for significant changes in our personal and work lives. But it’s the combination of these technologies that provides the foundation for Web3. 

    We can easily imagine a bright and shiny future powered by the increasing use cases and applications of blockchain technologies, but if we’re not careful, these can be a destabilizing force for society. 

    The same way that the two previous internet revolutions had positive and negative impacts, new technologies in Web3 carry potentially negative repercussions. Putting the control in the wrong hands can alter our future in undesirable ways if the goals are not aligned with the common good. 

    It’s a new era. Governments, business leaders, the scientific community, and citizens need to work together to define the paths, lead with values, and direct the technologies of Web3 to create sustainable applications and a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive society. Read on to learn more about approaching Web3 with ethics, trust, and safety at the forefront.

    Learn About Trust and Safety in Web3
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Articulate the ethical principles for Salesforce’s Web3 product innovation.
        Identify potential downsides and risks in Web3.
        Identify strategies and best practices for keeping safe and secure in the Web3 space. 

    Background

    Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs are driving innovation and commerce at scale. As with any early stage technology, potential outcomes can be unknown. Which is why it’s critical for those innovating in this space to do so in a responsible, ethical way. If we want Web3 to improve the lives of everyone within the ecosystem, not just a handful of people at the top, we need to design it in a values-led way. 

    Principles-Led Product Innovation

    At Salesforce, we believe that products in the Web3 space should be created with these principles in mind.

        Trust and Security. We will embed best-in-class brand and consumer protections, identifying—and preventing the use of the product for—fraud, force, or fear.
        Sustainability. We commit to quantify, disclose, minimize, and neutralize environmental impacts resulting in net zero emissions while driving increased sustainability in the sector more broadly.
        Equality. We will provide guidance and guardrails to ensure fairness, diversity, and empowerment of customers and consumers.
        Accountability. We will empower the end-user with explainable governance and engage stakeholders in ongoing evaluation.
        Integrity and Transparency. We commit to share clear, precise communication about the product and create trusted experiences and marketplaces where safety is top of mind. 

    We believe that by leading with our values, we can help guide this new space in a positive direction.
    The Challenges of an Emerging Web3 Landscape

    While there is much to be excited about when it comes to Web3, there’s also reason to proceed with a degree of caution as the space grows and matures. Here are some of the known and potential risks within the ecosystem. 

    Speculative Bubbles

    The Dutch tulip mania from 1634 to 1637 is the classic example of a significant difference between the financial value of an asset and its intrinsic value. It created a speculative bubble, which saw the price of tulips reach incredibly high levels. There have been many such bubbles since, and some claim that Web3 is in such a moment.

    Price Volatility

    Assets in Web3 are susceptible to price volatility, since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be argued to have no intrinsic value. And unlike other traditional currencies, they aren’t backed by a government or central bank. As a result, their price is driven only by supply and demand. As their value increases, this success may attract new investors, sending prices upward. On the flip side, a negative event or even a tweet can drive prices downward.

    Lack of Diversity

    NFTs sit at the intersection of two historically white and male dominated industries: visual art and crypto. The bulk of NFT sales—roughly 77%—are flowing to male creators while only 5% of sales go to female artists. Similarly, it’s posited that the average NFT purchaser is a 38-year-old male who makes over $100,000/year. This poses an issue for promoting equality and inclusion. If most of the NFT community is male and white, there is market pressure to create NFTs that mirror this population and create barriers to entry for nonwhite, nonmale folks to get involved in the space. 

    Lack of Privacy

    One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is it allows for anonymity. Connecting one’s identity to a wallet is optional, and many people prefer to keep their cryptocurrency wallet address private for good reason. Imagine if, when you sent digital payment to a lunch partner for your half of the meal, they could now see every other transaction you’d ever made—and not just on that platform, but the ones you made with your credit card, bank transfer, or other apps, and with no option to set the visibility of the transfers to “private.” 

    Immutability

    Another feature of blockchains is their immutability: Once data is written to the blockchain, it’s there forever. While this has many useful applications, such as for storing transaction records, it can be a challenge for user-created data, particularly when considering online abuse and harassment. If someone stores harmful, inflammatory or hateful material on a blockchain, it cannot be removed. The platforms might be petitioned to hide the content, but the offensive content would still remain on the chain.

    Lack of Third-Party Protection

    Third-party intermediaries, like banks or credit unions, play a critical role in safeguarding customers’ interests. Banks, for example, have ways of detecting activity by malicious actors, and consumers can challenge fraudulent transactions on their credit cards. When transactions take place without a third party, customers have no one to whom they can appeal for help. For example, if someone loses their private key—which functions like a password—then owners can no longer access their wallets, with no recourse. In January 2021, The New York Times reported that $140 billion worth of bitcoin is locked in wallets whose private keys have been lost or forgotten.
    The Early Days of Regulation

    Today, cryptocurrencies and NFTs are largely exempt from legal and financial regulation, which means there is little or no protection for those who create, invest, or trade in them. 

    For example:

    Data Hosting and Storage: An NFT and the digital asset it represents are usually stored separately. The NFT is stored on the blockchain and contains information about where the digital asset is located, but the NFT could be deleted or the server hosting it could fail or be hacked. This would make the NFT worth little or nothing—and the law has not yet addressed what rights the NFT owner would have in such a situation.

    Data Protection: NFTs may contain personal information that is subject to data protection laws. Some of these laws—like GDPR (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation)—allow individuals to erase or amend their personal data. However, NFTs are linked to the blockchain, where that is impossible (immutability!). These issues of security and data sharing for NFTs have so far received little consideration.

    Intellectual Property Rights: The buyer of an NFT may erroneously think they own the actual art associated with the NFT. In reality, the only person with the right to copy, distribute, alter, or publicly display the art is its original creator. There is the possibility that a disgruntled NFT buyer may bring legal action if they feel that there was misrepresentation when they were sold the NFT, as they believed they were buying the copyright.

    Taxation: The US and other nations have little or no legislation in this regard, nor any official advice relating to NFTs and tax. While it can be expected that profits and losses relating to NFTs would be liable for capital gains tax, and that the NFTs themselves would be considered assets for the purposes of other taxes—including inheritance tax—the official position has yet to be confirmed.
    Safety and Security in Web3

    Beyond the dynamics noted, there are a number of scams and frauds that are perpetrated in the NFT space, and it’s useful to be able to recognize and avoid them. Here are the six most common.

    Type
    	

    Description

    Rug pull
    	

    The originators of a crypto project take the capital raised from a token sale and disappear.

    Pump and dump
    	

    A particular crypto asset is hyped, leading to a short-term spike in the asset’s price as buy orders flood in. The instigators then sell off their holdings, triggering a crash, with other investors left “holding the bag.”

    Wash trading
    	

    The price of a crypto asset is artificially inflated by repeatedly trading it between wallets controlled by the same individual or group.

    Ponzi scheme
    	

    Capital from later investors in a crypto asset is used to pay returns to earlier investors.

    Hacking
    	

    Protocols or wallets are hacked and owners’ crypto assets stolen.

    Phishing
    	

    Attackers use social engineering techniques to trick a target into revealing information that can be used to gain access to their crypto assets.
    Ways to Protect Yourself

    How to Spot a Scam

    As a user, the first step of prevention is to keep your eyes peeled for potential signs of scams. Here’s how to recognize some common, dubious tactics. 

        Phishing: Users get a seemingly legitimate email from a platform or exchange they frequently use, with a malicious link embedded that lures them to make a transaction. Or it may even inject malware that scans for seed phrases stored in laptops.
        Hacking: Hackers sometimes airdrop malicious NFTs to user accounts as a Trojan Horse. Interacting with these malicious NFT airdrops prompt the user to sign a message that allows hackers to gain access and drain the account.
        FOMO: A cool new project comes up with a timer counting down on the purchase page, inducing serious FOMO (fear of missing out). When the user signs the transaction and makes that purchase, hackers obtain access to their wallets. Unknown to the user, the purchase page was linked to a scam URL. 

    Protect Your Seed Phrase and Secure Your Device

    A seed phrase is a group of words that are used to restore a crypto wallet. A seed phrase looks like this:

    rebuild-glow-language-lady-mushroom-poverty-episode-slow-meat-analyst-knee-output-oblige-couch-tilt 

    It’s very important to keep this phrase private and secure, since anyone with your seed phrase can use it to take over your wallet.

    This is where hackers come in and use various methods, including social engineering, to try and steal your seed phrase. One form of this is a scam where they pretend to be support staff from a marketplace or crypto business and ask for your details like your seed phrase or Metamask recovery QR code. Even experienced crypto-natives have fallen for these types of scams. Whenever someone asks you for this information, it should immediately set off alarm bells in your head. 

    Whatever type of wallet you use, take caution and practice a security-conscious approach to keeping your device and browser clear of any potential malware. This includes doing due diligence on websites you interact with, keeping your software up-to-date with security patches, and ignoring emails, links, or DMs from strangers.
    Best Practices

    Now that you’re aware of potential risks, let’s discuss how to mitigate them! Here are our overall best practices for staying safe in the new Web3 reality.

        Always visit the original website—a trusted, first-party marketplace—for any sale or offer.
        Only download applications and software from the originating source.
        If you’re using them, disable direct messages on Telegram and Discord from people who are not on your friends list.
        Never click any link sent to you from an unverified source without properly checking it.
        Never send your seed phrase to anyone.
        Never open an email link that looks suspicious.
        Never install any file with a “.exe” or “.scr” extension sent to you by an unknown sender.
        Never fill your wallet password and seed phrase into any form that you are not sure of.
        Store your cryptocurrency in a cold wallet or have multiple wallets (separating your daily use wallet from the wallet where you keep the bulk of your funds).
        Generate your keys securely—on a newly reset, offline device if possible.
        Keep your device, such as mobile phone or desktop, clear of malware and update frequently to the latest security patch.
        Make sure you interact only with audited smart contracts.
        Disconnect your wallet after every transaction.
        Be vigilant—always double-check your transactions, recipient addresses, and browser URL.
        Use common sense and trust your intuition—if something seems too good to be true, well, it just might be. 

    Conclusion

    As a company, Salesforce is deeply committed to creating technology with ethics and inclusion built-in—not bolted on. Our Office of Ethical and Humane Use actively partners with our product and engineering teams to approach product development with intention, identifying risks and innovating new solutions with our values at the core. The potential risks should not stop you from exploring and interacting with crypto and NFTs. There’s a world of opportunity out there, but just remember to take the necessary steps to protect yourself and proceed with caution.

    Learn Data Privacy Laws and Regulations
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain the importance of data privacy.
        Describe how privacy laws apply to your organization.
        Outline customer expectations regarding privacy. 

    Privacy Introduction

    As a security professional, it’s important to stay informed of the latest privacy laws that apply to your organization, especially if your organization handles customers’ personal data. Why is this so important? Ensuring your customer and employee data is protected is paramount to establishing and maintaining trust. In this module we’re going to review the tools for implementing an effective privacy program.

    If your organization stores and processes customer data, your customers trust you to protect, use, and process their data securely, in accordance with applicable laws. This data can include personal data such as contact, healthcare, or financial information, or business-related information such as expenditures, marketing, or analytics data.

    Regardless of what type of data you process or store, it’s important to keep it safe. In addition to processing or storing customer data, your organization is accountable for its own data, including knowledge about prospective customers, employee information, financial data, and more.

    So how do you ensure this data is protected? For starters, you should be aware of and follow applicable privacy laws. We get into the details of these privacy laws here. To document compliance with applicable privacy laws and protect yourself and your customers, it’s a good idea to have agreements in place when you’re collecting customer data. These agreements should detail how your organization will keep customer data secure and confidential. As an example, most international airlines are required to attest on their public websites to how they protect a customer’s privacy, what data they collect, and why and how it’s collected, used, assessed, safeguarded, and stored.
    Why Privacy Matters

    Let’s step back for a moment and review the concept of privacy and what it means. Privacy relates to how a piece of information—or data— should be managed and protected based on its relative importance.

    Data privacy has become a hot topic lately due to lapses in security and concerns about how companies are using the customer data they collect. Data privacy concerns are particularly important for companies in certain sectors such as finance and healthcare. These sectors contain sensitive information and are typically highly regulated. They also are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks, which if successful may result in not only loss of this data, but also loss of confidence by consumers. 

    Let’s look at an example. When you apply for a credit card, you’re typically required to provide your legal name, birthdate, address, government-issued identification number, and annual income. That’s a lot of information! Not only is this information used to verify your identity, but it also allows the credit card company to check your credit history. This information is considered your personal data, and the credit card company is required to put security measures in place to protect it.

    In this example, privacy means that the credit card company is responsible for protecting your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, that they’re transparent about how they use your personal data, that they use the data in accordance with applicable laws, and that you agree to the use of your data for a certain purpose.

    A laptop shows a person applying for a credit card online, with a file folder filled with dollar signs, and credit cards, overlain by a shield.
    Privacy Terminology

    Before we dive deeper into privacy laws, let’s review some basic definitions.

    Customer data: The information a customer provides while interacting with a business whether via a website, mobile application, social media, and more.

    Data subject: An individual whose personal data is collected, held, or processed.

    Personal data: The data that is directly attributable to a data subject and can identify an individual such as a name, home address, or personal identifier (for example, passport number).

    Sensitive personal data: Some types of personal data are considered sensitive and are subject to stricter regulation. This may include data about race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation.

    Processing: Any operation or set of operations on data (for example, access, collection, recording, retrieval, copying, storage, disclosure, dissemination, and so on).

    Controller: An individual or entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

    Processor: An individual or entity that processes personal data on behalf of a controller.

    Custodian (or handler): The individual responsible for the safe custody, transport, and storage of the data, and implementation of business rules. 

    Data Protection Authority (DPA): National authorities tasked with the protection of data and privacy as well as monitoring and enforcement of the data protection regulations within the Union.

    Your organization can act as both a processor and a controller, depending on the situation and the data involved. It’s helpful to think of the roles of processor and controller in relation to the allocation of responsibilities between parties. Your customers can be both controllers and processors. However, your organization always acts as a processor when a customer submits data to you and as controller when you determine the means and purposes of processing the data.
    Privacy Laws

    Depending on where your organization operates, you may need to adhere to location-specific privacy laws. If your organization operates globally, it’s important to implement policy requirements applicable to the country of operation. For example, if your organization operates in Japan, you are subject to the Act on the Protection of Personal Information.

    Privacy laws exist to protect individuals with respect to their personal data. They also regulate how personal data can and cannot be used. Let’s take a closer look at what privacy laws address.

        Whether personal data can be collected and processed
        What and how information should be provided around data processing practices
        Who can access and use the personal data
        How personal data can be processed
        How the data should be secured
        When to delete or amend the data
        Who is allowed to transport or have custody of the data
        Where and how personal data can be transferred to other countries
        How security incidents are handled
        What rights data subjects have regarding their personal data 

    Globally, there are two types of privacy laws: comprehensive (applicable to all industries and sectors) and sectoral (applicable to specific industries or sectors). In the US, the federal government has historically taken a sectoral approach. For example, there’s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is the US healthcare privacy law protecting data that reveals the health status of an individual (called protected health information or PHI). 

    The only US national privacy law that exists is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which regulates how online companies can collect and use data on children under the age of 13. 

    In the absence of a comprehensive national privacy law, several states have taken the initiative to  enact their own privacy legislation, including:

        California - California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
        Virginia - Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)
        Connecticut - Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)
        Utah - Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)
        Colorado - Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) 

    These states have either recently passed their own privacy legislation or are in the process of legislation. And many more states are considering doing the same. By passing their own privacy laws, these states provide their own protection for their constituents.

    In contrast, the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) take a more comprehensive approach through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is the EU’s and EEA’s privacy legislation and applies to all controllers and processors, irrespective of their industry or sector. However, there are also some sector-specific laws in Europe, such as for the telecoms sector.

    While not an exhaustive list, several other countries across the globe–including Japan, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa, and more–operate their own privacy laws, or are working on drafting them. Even though each country may have their own law, most privacy laws across the globe are based on the same core principles.

        Fairness and Transparency
        Purpose Limitation
        Data Minimization
        Accuracy
        Data Deletion and Retention
        Security
        Accountability
        Individual Rights
        International Transfers
        Data Privacy Impact Assessments 

    We take a closer look at these principles in the next unit.
    Customer Contracts and Service Level Agreements

    In addition to complying with privacy laws, organizations include privacy commitments in customer contracts or service level agreements (SLAs). These commitments detail ways your organization can use personal data, including those required by applicable law.
    International Privacy Certifications and Standards

    In addition to privacy laws, your organization may also be required to comply with certain certifications and standards that impose comprehensive privacy requirements. These certifications and standards vary by industry, but may include:

        International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001/27018, which provide requirements for information security management systems and for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors
        Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, which help companies establish trust and confidence in their service delivery processes and controls
        TRUSTe certification, which enables organizations to demonstrate responsible practices consistent with standards for privacy accountability
        International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27701, which is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management. It provides guidelines for the processing of PII and helps organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their Privacy Information Management System (PIMS). 

    Privacy Policies

    Your organization should abide by the commitments made to customers when you collect personal data from individuals. Also, your organization should maintain a privacy statement on your public website that describes the types of data you collect from users of your websites, and how you use and share that data. The commitments you make in that privacy statement should be similar to the ones you make in the contracts you sign with your customers. The same is true for internal privacy policies and employee notices that detail how you collect, use, share, and process employee data.
    Sum It Up

    You now have a better understanding of privacy concepts, laws, and customer expectations. In the next unit, we cover privacy principles and how you can apply them to protect your organization.

    So how do you ensure this data is protected? For starters, you should be aware of and follow applicable privacy laws. We get into the details of these privacy laws here. To document compliance with applicable privacy laws and protect yourself and your customers, it’s a good idea to have agreements in place when you’re collecting customer data. These agreements should detail how your organization will keep customer data secure and confidential. As an example, most international airlines are required to attest on their public websites to how they protect a customer’s privacy, what data they collect, and why and how it’s collected, used, assessed, safeguarded, and stored.
    Why Privacy Matters

    Let’s step back for a moment and review the concept of privacy and what it means. Privacy relates to how a piece of information—or data— should be managed and protected based on its relative importance.

    Data privacy has become a hot topic lately due to lapses in security and concerns about how companies are using the customer data they collect. Data privacy concerns are particularly important for companies in certain sectors such as finance and healthcare. These sectors contain sensitive information and are typically highly regulated. They also are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks, which if successful may result in not only loss of this data, but also loss of confidence by consumers. 

    Let’s look at an example. When you apply for a credit card, you’re typically required to provide your legal name, birthdate, address, government-issued identification number, and annual income. That’s a lot of information! Not only is this information used to verify your identity, but it also allows the credit card company to check your credit history. This information is considered your personal data, and the credit card company is required to put security measures in place to protect it.

    In this example, privacy means that the credit card company is responsible for protecting your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, that they’re transparent about how they use your personal data, that they use the data in accordance with applicable laws, and that you agree to the use of your data for a certain purpose.

    Privacy Terminology

    Before we dive deeper into privacy laws, let’s review some basic definitions.

    Customer data: The information a customer provides while interacting with a business whether via a website, mobile application, social media, and more.

    Data subject: An individual whose personal data is collected, held, or processed.

    Personal data: The data that is directly attributable to a data subject and can identify an individual such as a name, home address, or personal identifier (for example, passport number).

    Sensitive personal data: Some types of personal data are considered sensitive and are subject to stricter regulation. This may include data about race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation.

    Processing: Any operation or set of operations on data (for example, access, collection, recording, retrieval, copying, storage, disclosure, dissemination, and so on).

    Controller: An individual or entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

    Processor: An individual or entity that processes personal data on behalf of a controller.

    Custodian (or handler): The individual responsible for the safe custody, transport, and storage of the data, and implementation of business rules. 

    Data Protection Authority (DPA): National authorities tasked with the protection of data and privacy as well as monitoring and enforcement of the data protection regulations within the Union.

    Your organization can act as both a processor and a controller, depending on the situation and the data involved. It’s helpful to think of the roles of processor and controller in relation to the allocation of responsibilities between parties. Your customers can be both controllers and processors. However, your organization always acts as a processor when a customer submits data to you and as controller when you determine the means and purposes of processing the data.
    Privacy Laws

    Depending on where your organization operates, you may need to adhere to location-specific privacy laws. If your organization operates globally, it’s important to implement policy requirements applicable to the country of operation. For example, if your organization operates in Japan, you are subject to the Act on the Protection of Personal Information.

    Privacy laws exist to protect individuals with respect to their personal data. They also regulate how personal data can and cannot be used. Let’s take a closer look at what privacy laws address.

        Whether personal data can be collected and processed
        What and how information should be provided around data processing practices
        Who can access and use the personal data
        How personal data can be processed
        How the data should be secured
        When to delete or amend the data
        Who is allowed to transport or have custody of the data
        Where and how personal data can be transferred to other countries
        How security incidents are handled
        What rights data subjects have regarding their personal data 

    Globally, there are two types of privacy laws: comprehensive (applicable to all industries and sectors) and sectoral (applicable to specific industries or sectors). In the US, the federal government has historically taken a sectoral approach. For example, there’s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is the US healthcare privacy law protecting data that reveals the health status of an individual (called protected health information or PHI). 

    The only US national privacy law that exists is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which regulates how online companies can collect and use data on children under the age of 13. 

    In the absence of a comprehensive national privacy law, several states have taken the initiative to  enact their own privacy legislation, including:

        California - California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
        Virginia - Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)
        Connecticut - Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)
        Utah - Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)
        Colorado - Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) 

    These states have either recently passed their own privacy legislation or are in the process of legislation. And many more states are considering doing the same. By passing their own privacy laws, these states provide their own protection for their constituents.

    In contrast, the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) take a more comprehensive approach through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is the EU’s and EEA’s privacy legislation and applies to all controllers and processors, irrespective of their industry or sector. However, there are also some sector-specific laws in Europe, such as for the telecoms sector.

    While not an exhaustive list, several other countries across the globe–including Japan, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa, and more–operate their own privacy laws, or are working on drafting them. Even though each country may have their own law, most privacy laws across the globe are based on the same core principles.

        Purpose Limitation
        Data Minimization
        Accuracy

        Security
        Accountability
        Individual Rights
        International Transfers
        Data Privacy Impact Assessments 

    We take a closer look at these principles in the next unit.
    Customer Contracts and Service Level Agreements

    In addition to complying with privacy laws, organizations include privacy commitments in customer contracts or service level agreements (SLAs). These commitments detail ways your organization can use personal data, including those required by applicable law.
    International Privacy Certifications and Standards

    In addition to privacy laws, your organization may also be required to comply with certain certifications and standards that impose comprehensive privacy requirements. These certifications and standards vary by industry, but may include:

        International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001/27018, which provide requirements for information security management systems and for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors
        Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, which help companies establish trust and confidence in their service delivery processes and controls
        TRUSTe certification, which enables organizations to demonstrate responsible practices consistent with standards for privacy accountability
        International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27701, which is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management. It provides guidelines for the processing of PII and helps organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their Privacy Information Management System (PIMS). 

    Privacy Policies

    Your organization should abide by the commitments made to customers when you collect personal data from individuals. Also, your organization should maintain a privacy statement on your public website that describes the types of data you collect from users of your websites, and how you use and share that data. The commitments you make in that privacy statement should be similar to the ones you make in the contracts you sign with your customers. The same is true for internal privacy policies and employee notices that detail how you collect, use, share, and process employee data.
    Sum It Up

    You now have a better understanding of privacy concepts, laws, and customer expectations. In the next unit, we cover privacy principles and how you can apply them to protect your organization.

    Apply Data Privacy Principles
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        List 10 key privacy principles.
        Explain how the principles can be implemented in your organization. 

    Privacy Principles

    Now that you have a good understanding of data privacy basics, let’s dive into some principles and how they apply to your organization. Although legal requirements vary globally, there are some common principles that provide the foundation for many privacy laws. Let’s delve into these principles which we introduced in the previous unit.

    Fairness and Transparency

    Organizations should process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent way.

    Your organization may implement this principle by processing personal data in accordance with applicable laws and the privacy commitments or service level agreements (SLAs) made to your customers and end users. As aforementioned, it’s also a good idea to publish a privacy statement on your website detailing what personal data is collected in your capacity as a data controller and why, including information collected through cookies and analytics. In your privacy statement, it’s important to indicate the information types that you will not collect. Ultimately, no matter how you receive privacy data, you should obtain consent before processing it. 

    Purpose Limitation

    Organizations should process personal data only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes. 

    At your organization, this means that anytime you collect personal data, you clearly communicate and are specific about how the data will be used. In most cases, if you want to use the data for something other than what was communicated, you must present a valid legal reason and seek permission before processing it.

    Data Minimization

    Organizations should only collect the minimum amount of data necessary for the processing purpose in question. 

    Your organization shouldn’t collect personal data unless it’s necessary to perform your offered services. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data shall be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed,” while the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) calls this the “minimum necessary” rule.

    So, how does data minimization work? Let’s say you’re building an internal mobile app for your organization’s complimentary shuttle bus offered to employees. The data the app needs to collect and process includes employee personal data such as their home and office addresses, and other basic information (that is, name and phone number). However, the app doesn’t need an employee’s date of birth, ethnicity, or health or financial information. Since this additional information isn’t required, you shouldn’t collect it.

    Accuracy

    Personal data should be kept accurate and up to date.

    As a service provider to your customers, your organization needs to make sure your systems contain accurate records and reflect customer changes to data when they occur. Any data that’s considered inaccurate must have mechanisms to immediately erase or correct it.

    Data Deletion and Retention

    Organizations should only store personal data for as long as it’s required and for the originally intended purpose.

    Your organization shouldn’t keep data for an indefinite period even if it may be used in the future. Clear time frames should be established for when data is deleted with rationale for why the data is retained for that length of time. For example, you may need to retain security log files for certain periods of time to identify and track malicious adversary behaviors. However, the period still must remain finite, with supporting rationale. You should also be aware of data retention laws for specific types of data, such as legal documents, within the country where your organization provides that service.

    Security

    Organizations should use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized processing, accidental disclosure, loss, destruction, and alteration. 

    Your organization needs to ensure that security systems adequately protect data. You can also help protect and secure the data you store through privacy enhancing techniques. Let’s discuss a few.

        Data segregation is the division of data into various data categories for the purposes of dividing or restricting access to different classes of data. Using this technique allows your organization to create separate access rules for datasets or different groups of users, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access.
        Encryption is a security method where information is scrambled into an unreadable format that can be accessed or decrypted only by a user with the correct key. Encryption protects the confidentiality of the data.
        Pseudonymization replaces the information that can identify a subject with pseudonyms or identifiers. It reduces the chance that personal data records and identifiers can identify an individual.
        Anonymization is the process of protecting private or sensitive information by erasing, obfuscating (masking), or encrypting it. It removes all identifiers associated with a person. 

    Other security measures may exist at your organization to support data protection. It’s recommended that all employees with access to computing systems receive privacy training regardless of position, and read and acknowledge employee acceptable use policies.

    Accountability

    Your organization should create policies and implement processes that demonstrate you’re in compliance with privacy laws, regulations, and principles for data privacy.

    You should take measures to advance privacy through design and privacy by default.

        Privacy by design: Privacy by design occurs when an organization begins planning for a new or improved process, or activity, or when developing a new product, service, or feature. 

    When your organization builds a new product, they should consider privacy policies and principles during the plan and design phase. It’s important to include all relevant stakeholders in this planning and design process, and legal teams, to make sure privacy is a priority and that your organization is abiding by the law.

        Privacy by default: Organizations should choose the most privacy-friendly default settings when collecting, processing, or storing personal data. For instance, if you were to sign up for an online social network account and plan to use one of its services, they may say they’re compliant with the privacy by default principle, requiring just your name and email address to function. However, if the social networking account immediately starts sharing your location or any other data outside of name and email address, they’re not adhering to the privacy by default principle. 

    Individual Rights

    Privacy laws also detail a data subject’s rights to their personal data. These rights include:

        Data subject access request: Data subjects have the right to access a copy of any personal data a controller holds about them and receive confirmation that a controller is processing their personal data. They’re also entitled to details about the purposes of the processing, the categories being processed, how long the data is stored, and with whom the personal data has been shared.
        Right to object: Data subjects can, in certain cases, object to how their personal data is used.
        Data correction: Data subjects can request that their personal data is corrected or completed if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
        Restriction: Data subjects can request that a company stop processing their personal data in limited circumstances.
        Right to deletion: Also known as “the right to be forgotten,” or under GDPR, the right to erasure, this empowers data subjects to request that a controller delete their personal data under certain conditions. Because the US is sectoral-based regarding privacy, most US privacy laws don’t have this right. One exception is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
        Data portability: Where applicable to the type of processing, data subjects have the right to ask a controller to provide their personal data in an exportable format so they can transmit their data to another controller. 

    Your organization’s obligation as a service provider is to assist your customers to manage these requests. As a controller, you’re responsible for complying with data subject requests, and the systems you use to manage personal data should accommodate such requests, including access, correction, deletion, and portability.

    International Transfers

    Certain countries and regions, such as the European Union (EU), restrict the transfer of personal data outside the country or region of origin unless the destination has implemented sufficient safeguards to guarantee the data is protected. If your organization operates internationally, you should implement measures that ensure you can legally transfer personal data across these boundaries.

    Data Protection Impact Assessment 

    When your organization collects, stores, or uses personal data, the individuals whose data you’re processing are exposed to risks. These risks range from theft with the intent to impersonate an individual, to accidental disclosure. Within GDPR, your organization is required to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). According to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), a DPIA is designed to assess data likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of people, and to identify and minimize these risks as early as possible. Your organization may want to consider conducting a DPIA before launching data collection or processing activities that pose higher risks to data subjects.

    Get to Know Customer Data and Your Data Custodians
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Identify which information is considered customer data.
        Explain the difference between the two types of data custodians.
        Summarize what data custodians can and cannot do with data. 

    Customer Data

    The way we define customer data is that it’s the information submitted by or on behalf of a customer directly to one of your services. Customer data can take several forms and include the following.

        Personal data
        Contact information
        Account information
        Marketing data 

    Personal Data

    Personal data involves both personally identifiable information (PII) and non-PII. PII is any information used to recognize or link an individual to an identity. It includes items such as first or last name, physical address, protected health information (PHI), location, age, and more. Non-PII is anonymous information that can potentially identify more than one person (IP addresses, device identification, web cookies, and more).

    Contact Information

    Contact information provides the means to communicate with a person, such as a personal or business phone number or email address.

    Account Information

    Account information holds critical data about a customer’s user account, including name, order, billing, interaction, and credit information.

    Marketing Data

    Marketing data is any information that is of benefit to marketing teams, such as competitive intelligence, market research, commercial transactions, customer feedback, preferences and interests, and other metrics.

    You should define customer data in your service level agreements (SLAs) to stay in sync with your customers on what is considered customer data and what rules apply to it.
    What Is Not Customer Data

    Not all data your customers provide to you is considered customer data. For example, information your customers share with you via any means outside of your offered services is not customer data. This may include information your customer shares with you before they sign up for your services, or information you obtain from publicly available sources or third-party content providers. 
    Types of Data Custodians

    Now that you have a solid understanding of privacy laws, customer commitments, privacy principles, and what’s considered customer data, let’s introduce you to data custodians and discuss how they fit into the picture.

    There are likely two types of data custodians at your organization: personal and customer.

    Personal data custodians are those who access and handle personal data. Some examples of personal data custodians are:

        Salespeople who have access to customers’ and prospective customers’ personal data.
        Marketing personnel who manage email and digital marketing to individuals.
        Human resources, IT, payroll, security, managers, and other personnel who have access to employee data. 

    Customer data custodians access and handle customer data (which can include personal data). These custodians are generally a selected group of employees within your organization who have access to customer data. Typically, customer data custodians fall under technical support operations or customer support.

    While there are some requirements that apply to both personal data custodians and customer data custodians, there are typically additional requirements that apply only to customer data custodians. That’s because customer data is subject to your customer contracts and SLAs, which may go beyond what privacy laws require. Let’s look at some baseline requirements for data custodians.

    Data Custodian Responsibilities

        Implement technical controls for safeguarding data confidentiality.
        Limit, authorize, and control access to personal and customer data.
        Maintain technical processes to sustain data integrity.
        Validate that data added to datasets are consistent with a common data model.
        Process, access, handle, or view personal or customer data as necessary to perform their duties.
        Adhere to policies on internal and external data sharing. 

    If you’re unsure about sharing personal data outside of your organization, contact your legal department for assistance.

    Report Data Privacy Security Incidents
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain what constitutes a data privacy security incident.
        Identify potential data privacy security incidents.
        Know what to do when you suspect or know a data privacy security incident has happened. 

    What Is a Security Incident?

    Many authorities around the world have adopted security incident notification laws, from the European Union (EU) to countries in Latin America (LATAM) to Japan and Asia-Pacific (JAPAC) regions to every United States (US) state and territory. Recently in the US, the president signed into law the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022, which requires critical infrastructure companies to report significant cybersecurity incidents and all ransom payments to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

    Depending on the country your organization operates out of, there are numerous incident reporting laws and regulations for specific industries such as government, healthcare, energy, telecoms, and financial services providers, with each adopting their own definition of what constitutes a security incident (or data breach). Depending on the security incident notification laws that impact your organization, your customer service level agreements (SLAs) or contracts should contain security incident notification requirements that apply to customer data.

    A data privacy security incident is any unauthorized use of personal data or customer data, whether accidental or intended. Consider these examples of common security incidents.

        A sales representative sends an email with customer data to the wrong customer.
        A manager prints a resume of a candidate, but on his way home, he leaves the document on the train.
        A former employee who has left the company still has access to your organization’s systems and accesses customer records.
        An intern opens an email attachment containing malware, which results in deleted or encrypted customer contact information.
        A shared drive is overly permissioned, granting too many people access to personal data.
        A customer’s credentials or secret keys are exposed on a public GitHub repository.
        An employee’s work device (for example, a laptop or smartphone) is lost or stolen.
        An employee accidentally discloses personal data in a response to an email that turns out to be part of a phishing attack. 

    All these incidents qualify as potential security incidents and should be reported to your organization’s security team.
    Reporting a Security Incident

    If you suspect a potential data privacy incident, report it immediately, even if you’re not 100% sure the incident qualifies as a data breach or security incident. If your organization has an annual security awareness training program in place, make sure to review it for up-to-date information regarding how to report suspicious activity or suspected security incidents at your organization.

    When reporting an incident, you should provide as much information as possible, including:

        What happened
        Who the individuals or groups involved were
        The time, date, and time zone of when the incident occurred
        Which services were involved or potentially impacted
        Point of contact for follow-up questions 

    Security Incident Reporting Timelines

    Your organization may have a legal obligation to report data privacy incidents within a short time frame to regulators, customers, and affected individuals. You have an obligation to report security incidents immediately to your internal security team, to allow them time to investigate the incident and meet external reporting requirements. In some cases, failure to notify applicable parties of a data privacy incident within the required time frames can lead to substantial fines, a potential breach of your contractual obligations, damage to customer trust, and tarnishing of your organization’s reputation.

    As you can see, it’s critical to report all potential security incidents right away, even if you made the mistake that led to the exposure of personal or customer data.

    Get to Know the Public Sector
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Define the public sector.
        Describe the types of work performed in the public sector.
        List the reasons public sector employees are potential cybersecurity targets.
        Explain the importance of meeting compliance standards.
        List the risks resulting in the misuse of public sector data.

    Before You Start

    If you completed the Get Started with Cloud Security Engineering trail then you already know about cloud computing and how to design secure cloud solutions. Now, let’s talk about how to improve the security of public sector data in the cloud.
    Overview of the Public Sector

    The public sector consists of national, state, and local governments. These entities provide critical infrastructure like roads, bridges, and water. They operate public transportation. They administer elections. They even strengthen national defense and secure national security systems. In recent years, many public sector organizations have adopted digital technology to provide better service and more transparency for their citizens. However, this broad array of service offerings makes these public sector entities attractive to a variety of cybersecurity threat actors.

    To improve speed, scale, and cost of these digital technologies, many public sector organizations are migrating and modernizing some or all public services using cloud-based offerings. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources—for example, networks, servers, storage, applications (apps), and services—that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. 

    Cloud computing provides public sector organizations the flexibility and scalability to meet modern technology demands. These organizations may use their own cloud for internal resources. Or they can use the secure cloud services of a private company—also known as a cloud service provider (CSP)—approved specifically for public sector organizations. They can even use a distributed hybrid deployment model that employs a mix of public sector infrastructure and private cloud services. 

    The shift to cloud computing has helped improve cybersecurity by taking advantage of the security expertise offered by CSPs. But it isn't without risk. Mapping out those risks and their impacts is critical to assuring the cloud and the data residing in it remains secure.

    Cloud Security

    Cloud security consists of a set of policies, controls, procedures, and technologies that work together to protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure. These security measures are configured to protect cloud data, support regulatory compliance, and safeguard customers’ privacy.

    Cloud security responsibilities are shared between public sector organizations and CSPs in contrast to a public sector-owned and managed data center. Depending on the cloud configuration and licensing agreement, public sector users may have more or less control over how shared resources and data are accessed. It’s important to note that moving to the cloud does not transfer security responsibility to the CSP. While the CSP may operate certain security controls on the public sector organizaton’s behalf, the public sector customer is ultimately responsible for validating that they do so effectively.

    Cloud Service Models

    NIST defines the following cloud service models in order of level of management provided by CSP vendors.

        Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Vendors provide the basic infrastructure and hardware.
        Platform as a Service (PaaS): Vendors provide a managed environment for a customer’s app.
        Software as a Service (SaaS): Vendors provide a fully managed app, and customers need only supply their data.

    When customer data is processed, stored, or transmitted off-premise and under the control of a third party, such as a CSP, the ability of the data owner to implement security controls is often limited. In cloud computing environments, the implementation of controls is largely dependent upon the type of service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), the type of cloud deployment model (private, public, hybrid, multi-cloud), the type of controls (physical versus logical), and the specifications of responsibility delineated in the contract between the public sector organization and the CSP.

    It’s critical that public sector customers choose services accordingly and understand the risks and limitations of third-party control. Public sector organizations can outsource the functionality of a role, such as storage management, but must still verify security requirements like encryption are implemented. Whether you’re a private CSP employee or a public sector employee, if you have access to public sector cloud services, you have privileged access to critical infrastructure, networks, and data. Let’s dig a bit deeper into what makes public sector cloud security concerns unique. 
    Public Sector Data Security Requirements

    Public sector cloud services have unique security compliance requirements. Data stored in a public sector cloud platform must be adequately maintained and secured to meet these special compliance requirements. As more organizations adopt the cloud, public sector organizations have created a number of security aids, standards, and regulations to safeguard those transitions. The table lists some regulations and standards that outline public sector data security requirements in the US.  

    Regulation/Standard
    	

    Description

    Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014
    	

    Strengthens information security within US federal agencies by requiring them to implement information security programs to ensure their systems’ confidentiality, integrity, and availability

    NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
    	

    Provides a framework for federal agencies, contractors, and other sources that use or operate a federal information system to develop and implement a risk-based approach to manage information security risk

    Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS PUB 199)
    	

    Outlines impact levels of data, which are are a way of categorizing the sensitivity of data and what controls are necessary to secure data of varying sensitivity levels

    NIST 800-53
    	

    Defines security controls for information systems (including cloud systems) containing public sector data, including access control, media protection, and physical and environmental protections

    Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
    	

    Defines security baselines for cloud services based upon the NIST 800-53 controls

    Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide
    	

    Builds upon FedRAMP to tailor control baselines for DoD mission owners by providing a knowledge base for cloud computing security authorization processes and security requirements 

    Here are some examples of security compliance requirements for public sector cloud services in other countries.

        India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) provides requirements and guidelines for CSPs to register their services with the Indian government to be considered eligible to work with public sector entities in India.
        The Japanese government has a system called the Information System Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) for assessing the security of CSPs to participate in public sector projects.
        The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has an Information Security Registered Assessor’s Program (IRAP) framework, which assesses the implementation and effectiveness of an organization’s security controls against the Australian government’s security requirements.

    Discover more comprehensive compliance certifications and attestations. No matter the country, cloud security compliance requirements put in place data location constraints, requirements for identity management, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), and more. 
    Threat Actor Targets and Meeting Compliance Standards

    Whether you’re a private CSP employee or a public sector employee with access to critical security systems, infrastructure, networks, and accounts, you’re a primary target for cybercriminals and foreign intelligence organizations. Combating all such threats is critical to national security and a well-functioning civil society. As a critical part of an organization’s defenses, you play an important role in protecting privacy and security.

    As someone with access to public sector data, you need to be aware of, understand, and follow the increased security, privacy, and compliance measures that platforms containing this data require, and what threats to public sector cloud services may look like. This requires validating on an ongoing basis that the security controls you’ve selected are actually implemented and functioning properly. Luckily, CSPs provide a range of features and services that public sector customers can use to build cloud solutions to meet their security needs.

    Risks of Misuse of Public Sector Data

    There are varying levels of risk to public sector data if the CIA of the data is compromised. Depending on the type of information breached, a victim can suffer social, economic, or physical harm. If an identity thief gets hold of the compromised information, the victim may face financial loss, damaged credit, compromised medical records, threats, or harassment.

    If public sector data is misused, your organization can also suffer financially. If the root cause of data loss is due to your organization not adhering to laws and regulations, your organization or its staff can be subject to criminal or civil penalties, or incur additional costs associated with responding and recovering from the incident, including having to fund credit monitoring for your customers.

    Your organization can also be required to receive close scrutiny from regulators. In the end, organizations can put their public reputation at risk and shatter public confidence if they don’t protect public sector data. As someone with access to public sector data, it’s your responsibility to review and assess the risks associated with misuse of public sector data, and do your part to minimize them.
    Sum It Up

    Now that you understand more about the public sector and why users dealing with public sector data are potential cybersecurity targets, let’s take a look at one specific type of threat to public sector data security: insider threat.

    Identify Insider Threats to Public Sector Data
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain the concept of insider threat.
        Define insiders and insider threat categories.
        Identify ways insider threats can happen at your organization.
        Explain ways you can defend yourself from insider threat.
        Identify insider threat and security reporting recommendations.

    What Is Insider Threat?

    An insider is any individual who has access to your organization’s facilities, systems, technology, customer data, or staff. Insiders can include public sector employees, former employees, contractors, subcontractors, and even customers. As more information is stored in the cloud, staff with access to these systems could potentially threaten your organization.

    Cybersecurity measures are frequently focused on threats from outside an organization rather than from individuals inside an organization. However, insider threats are the source of many security incidents across industries. They can potentially steal sensitive data, perform malicious attacks on your networks, and damage or destroy systems and services. 

    There are generally two categories of insider threat: accidental and intentional. Some behaviors that lead to unintentional threats include:

        Using unauthorized removable media
        Using personal email for work activities
        Falling for phishing emails
        Using unauthorized applications (apps) and software
        Failing to fully test changes to systems before pushing them to widespread use

    On the flip side, intentional insiders use their access deliberately to cause malicious harm. For example, they may steal confidential information about public sector services for personal or financial gain, or damage systems or destroy data in retribution for a missed promotion, involuntary termination, or other grievance. 
    Challenges to Detecting Insider Threats

    Malicious acts by insiders are seldom impulsive. Usually, stressful events happen over time that result in the transition of a trusted insider to a malicious one. If not identified and resolved in a healthy manner, these stressors could contribute to an individual’s intent to cause harm to your organization and its staff. That’s why it’s important to identify and resolve potential stressors early on. Additionally, external factors can be at play. An insider could be targeted by an external organization and bribed, or could be extorted.

    Insider threat actors can be difficult to detect and often go unnoticed. As someone who deals with public sector data in the cloud, you serve as the eyes and ears of the organization, and need to pay attention to indicators of insider risk.
    What Are Risk Indicators?

    There are two types of risk indicators: direct and indirect. Direct risk indicators include the following types of behavior.

        Occasional display of suspicious or disruptive behavior
        Attempts to gain access to information or data that’s outside the scope of an employee’s job responsibilities, including attempts to recruit or coerce others into giving information or doing something suspicious
        Bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees
        Workplace violence incidents
        Serious violations of organization cloud policies
        Disregard of security procedures and protocols
        Financial changes including unexplained affluence or excessive debt
        Working or show up for work under the influence
        Physical and logical access to facilities or proprietary information outside of normal work hours

    Indirect risk indicators are behaviors that require additional analysis to reveal suspicious motives. They can include the following.

        Visible animosity toward a coworker
        Sudden decline in work performance
        Irresponsible use of social media

    Defend Against Insider Threats

    Measures to defend against insider threats include documenting expectations in security agreements, monitoring, cooperating with Human Resources (HR), implementing data protections, and reporting in a timely manner. Let’s take a closer look.

    Security Agreements

    To help protect against insider threats, public sector employees should define explicit security agreements for any cloud services, especially regarding access restrictions and monitoring capabilities. Public sector data hosted in a private sector cloud service provider (CSP) is under the care of a third party. Malicious insiders who work for the CSP might be able to access the data stored in the cloud for multiple public sector organizations.

    One tool to consider in strengthening the security of cloud systems containing public sector data is to put in place terms and conditions to document trust relationships between organizations owning, operating, or maintaining the information systems. For example, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) moderate baseline recommends this control. These agreements can help document expectations around access to the information system, and how information is processed, stored, or transmitted. Whether this step is necessary depends on the compliance regimes applicable to the organization, and what existing sharing and trust agreements exist between the organizations.

    Security Assessments

    Another tool for defending against insider threat and bolstering the security of cloud systems containing public sector data is to develop a security assessment plan. For example, the FedRAMP moderate baseline recommends agencies to assess security controls on both an initial and ongoing basis, continuously monitor their IT systems, and ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures, among other security practices.

    Monitoring

    Whether you work at a public sector organization, a CSP, or a third-party vendor, if you process and store public sector data in the cloud, you have a responsibility to monitor that data. Security monitoring in the cloud includes capturing, reviewing, and correlating audit log data. Also consider logging and reviewing all activities performed by users within cloud environments. Check for events such as abnormal login times or attempts to access unauthorized resources.

    Organizations dealing with public sector data can consider using user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) solutions that use algorithms and machine learning to detect anomalies in the behavior of not only the users in a corporate network but also the routers, servers, and endpoints in that network. UEBA can help you to recognize any peculiar or suspicious behavior, such as instances where there are irregularities from normal everyday patterns or usage. For example, if a network user regularly downloads files of 20 megabytes every day but starts downloading 40 gigabytes of files, the UEBA system considers this an anomaly and alerts an information technology (IT) admin. Or if automations are in place, it automatically disconnects that user from the network.

    Integrate with Human Resources

    Another important measure is integrating insider threat defenses with Human Resources (HR). HR professionals are more likely to identify patterns, behavior, and trends that help mitigate potential harm to an organization and its employees. For example, HR can identify red flags during the interview process, creating mechanisms for employees and managers to provide two-way feedback and share concerns. HR can also provide suggestions for delivering notifications of termination respectfully and in a way that minimizes intrusiveness and embarrassment. Depending upon an employee’s role, there may also be separation agreements that are required to continue confidentiality post-employment.

    HR also has insights to employee performance records and potential disciplinary actions for correlating events back to certain behaviors. It’s critical that HR perform pre-hire background checks that are regularly updated after hire, obtain employee acknowledgement of policies and practices, and provide training on insider threats.

    Data Protections

    Additionally, it’s important that public sector organizations ensure that their data protection and monitoring requirements for CSPs are commensurate with the organization’s own requirements. It’s vital that protections include physical and technological requirements, and HR requirements for CSP employees.

    Timely Reporting

    As someone who works with public sector data, you can serve as the first line of defense for insider threats by reporting unusual activity to your organization’s security team. Your organization’s incident response team can investigate unauthorized access to data or attempts to circumvent security configurations by keeping an eye on suspicious activities or threat indicators. Depending on your organization’s requirements, you may also need to report unusual activity to your human resources team, or outside groups such as law enforcement.

     

    If something at work doesn’t feel right—an unusual access request or information request, for example—don’t hesitate to contact your organization’s incident response or security team right away. Keep in mind that the longer an attacker is on your network, the deeper they can go, the more backdoors they can open, and the more data they may be able to extract. Any public sector data displayed outside the cloud’s authorized boundaries constitutes a security incident and should be reported immediately. This applies not only to customer data but also to any information that can impact the CIA of the cloud environment.

    Acting fast when you spot a potential security incident is critical, because it helps your incident response team track down the source and thwart any potential damage. What’s more, if your organization has a security incident involving public sector data, you may be subject to external reporting requirements. For example, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), organizations have just 72 hours to gather all related information and report data breaches to the relevant regulator.

    By reporting suspected incidents to your organization’s incident response team immediately, your organization is better able to meet its external reporting requirements. If your organization fails to meet these requirements, you can incur fines, damage customer and investor trust, and continue to repeat past mistakes.
    Sum It Up

    In this unit, you learned about insider threats and the concern they pose for protecting public sector data in the cloud. Now, let’s turn our attention to an important security control to consider when managing and protecting public sector data in the cloud: access control.

    Secure Public Sector Data
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe how to safeguard high value assets in the cloud.
        Explain how to securely handle public sector data in the cloud.
        Identify media protections for public sector data in the cloud.
        List best practices for data backup and storage in the cloud.

    Now that we’ve talked about access control and encryption, let’s continue by discussing data handling controls for protecting public sector data in the cloud.
    High-Value Assets

    High-value assets (HVAs)—that sounds important, doesn’t it? That’s because it is! An HVA is information or an information system that is so critical to an organization that the loss or corruption of this information or loss of access to the system results in a serious impact on the organization’s ability to perform its mission or conduct business. It’s no surprise then that it’s essential to have special controls in place to protect these types of assets, especially when hosted in the cloud. These controls should be outlined in your organization’s data classification standard. The last thing you want is for a cybercriminal to gain unauthorized access to high value asset data, including public sector information!

    To identify and protect high-value assets, start with a business impact analysis (BIA), which predicts the consequences of disruption of a business function and gathers information needed to develop recovery strategies. During the BIA, identify potential loss scenarios and associated costs from a compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of mission critical data. Also identify recommendations for recovery. Depending upon the data contained in the HVA, it may be necessary to conduct other reviews, such as a Privacy Impact Assessment.

    Because of the importance of safeguarding HVAs, only allow as small as necessary a subset of your organization’s employees access to them. Have policies and procedures in place for managing HVAs, and cover protections while the data is stored in your systems and when it’s shared externally.
    Secure Data Handling

    To make sure you handle public sector data in a way that complies with your organization’s requirements, always keep sensitive data in controlled, approved, and secure cloud environments with backup capabilities. Production servers provide greater security than your laptop, for example. Here are some additional steps you can take to keep public sector data secure.

        Avoid accessing public sector data unless it’s required for your job.
        Only access the data from an authorized or approved device issued by your organization.
        Avoid downloading data to your computer, unless required for your job.
        Do not export any information from a cloud environment whose disclosure can impact the CIA of the environment.
        Do not use an external email account to send information.
        Use only approved third-party storage sites.
        Limit printing of data to only what’s necessary for your job, and keep your desk clean of sensitive data when stepping away or leaving for the day.
        Encrypt and back up data to mitigate risk if data is lost or stolen.
        Do not store information on Universal Serial Buses (USBs) or external hard drives.

    You may be wondering what type of information disclosure can impact the CIA of your environment. This can include, for example, if a medical provider at the Department of Veterans Affairs exports patient data from the cloud system hosting that data, and emails it to the wrong patient. In determining potential impact, it’s key you consider the quantity of sensitive data. For example, breaches of 25 records of personally identifiable information (PII) and 25 million records may have different impacts. 

    Also evaluate the sensitivity of the data fields when combined. Aggregating different data sets can increase the potential impact to the information if disclosed improperly. For this reason, it’s best to de-identify information where possible by removing account numbers, names, and other identifiable information when aggregating information. 

    A USB crossed out
    Media Protection

    Whether at a cloud service provider (CSP) or a public sector organization, a limited number of employees need access to media that contains public sector data. It’s imperative that your organization maintains a media protection policy that describes how to properly handle backup tapes and other digital media like portable hard drives and USBs. In the policy, address media marking, storage, transport, sanitization, disposal, and use. If you’re in a position with access to media containing public sector data, it’s critical to review your organization’s policies and familiarize yourself with these processes.

    Data Backup and Storage

    In addition to identifying your mission critical data, it’s crucial that your organization backs up this data to maintain accessibility to pertinent information. Per your organization’s information security standards, back up public sector data in the cloud at a frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives. Define these objectives in your BIA. Define specific guidelines pertaining to these objectives by the regulations and standards applicable to your organization’s jurisdiction.

        The recovery time objective (RTO) documents the amount of time an organization has to restore its processes to an acceptable service level after a disruption to avoid intolerable consequences associated with the disruption.
        The recovery point objective (RPO) documents how fresh the recovered data must be.

    Protect backup information and media at all storage locations, whether in the cloud or at an off-site storage facility. Sanitize, destroy, or both, data that’s no longer required in line with your organization’s data retention policy or standard. Define specific guidelines pertaining to data sanitization by the regulations and standards applicable to your organization's jurisdiction. Consider using a combination of online and offline backups for further recovery options.
    The Bottom Line

    You are the strongest link in your organization’s security efforts. You now have the knowledge to protect and safeguard your organization and customers. As someone who deals with public sector data in the cloud, you’re entrusted with very sensitive data. It’s up to you to be compliant and vigilant in your efforts to stay secure. Don’t forget, if you see something, say something by contacting your organization’s security team. Interested in learning more about cybersecurity careers and technologies?

    Identify Secrets
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Identify three types of secrets at your organization.
        Define authentication, authorization, and encryption.
        Explain strong key management principles. 

    What Is a Secret?

    Customer trust issues can derail even the best-laid cybersecurity plans. Your customers rely on you to safeguard their data, and to keep that data safe from anyone who does not have a business need to access it, even someone inside your organization’s network. While protections like network segmentation protect data, code, and applications from external and internal threats, it’s still up to you to manage secret information carefully. 

    So, just what is a secret? You can define secrets in three main ways. 

        Credentials that authenticate individual identities for systems and services
        Private keys used to sign certificates that authorize services to other services
        Keys used to encrypt other secret information like customer data 

    If you start with these definitions, you can sort your secrets into categories. The first category is passwords, or other credentials that you use to protect your laptop, phone, and organizational access. The second category is the private keys that services use to provide access to sensitive systems, services, and information. And the third category is the keys used to encrypt content like customer and organizational data, so that even if it is accessed, it is kept secret. 

    Password Versus Key

    For most computer security purposes and for most users, a key is not the same thing as a password, although a password can be used as a key. The primary difference between keys and passwords is that passwords are intended to be generated, read, remembered, and reproduced by a human user. 

    A key, by contrast, is intended for use by the software that is implementing the cryptographic algorithm, so human readability is not required. In fact, most users are, in most cases, unaware of the existence of the keys being used on their behalf by the security components of their everyday software applications.

    Secrets are never as simple as they seem, and handling secrets well involves several tricky factors. When managing secrets, here are some good questions to ask.

    How secret is this secret? How many humans know it? How many places is it stored? How hard would it be for an attacker to learn or guess it? Good secrets should be very hard to guess and obtain if you’re not supposed to have them.

    Will this secret always be available when needed? Let’s say your service needs a secret to do its job. If the service storing that secret goes down, your customers are going to have a rough day without access to the system they need. The availability of secrets depends on the availability of your service overall.

    As your organization continues to innovate with new technologies, effective secret management becomes even more important.
    Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption

    There are three main ways to protect secrets: authentication, authorization, and encryption. They are all related, and they often overlap with one another. Sometimes they are used in combination, such as when a system authenticates your identity and then checks whether you’re authorized to access that system. At other times, systems encrypt secrets so that they cannot be understood without being decrypted.  

    Authentication

    Authentication is the process of proving your identity. Let’s say you are trying to log in to your company’s website as yourself. The website asks you to enter your password so it knows it’s you. Authentication assures you that a call is actually coming from a service you trust and not from an attacker. 

    Authentication can be single-factor or multi-factor (MFA). A factor is what you use to authenticate, and it falls into one of three categories.

        Something you have: Examples include a proximity key like a wireless key fob, or a magnetic strip card like your personal debit card
        Something you are: Examples include a fingerprint or facial identification
        Something you know: Examples include a password, passphrase, or personal identification number (PIN) 

    Single-factor authentication is when you use just one of these factors to authenticate, such as when you type in your username and password (something you know) to log in to your email. MFA requires two or more of these items, like when you use your credit card (something you have) and enter your PIN (something you know) to complete a transaction. 

    Authorization 

    Authorization is the next step after authentication. Now that you have verified your identity, what are you allowed to do? One user shouldn’t be authorized to change another user’s password, for example.

    Another example of authorization, are the resources you have access to for your job. If you work on the Finance team, you shouldn’t be able to access a Human Resources database, and vice versa. You only see the resources that you are authorized to use. 

    For high-security processes, you may need to demonstrate that you’re authorized by more than one group in order to gain access. This is known as quorum authorization. For example, if you’re an auditor and need temporary access to a secure financial system, you may require approval from both the business owner of the system and a senior administrator. This method prevents any one group from providing access to secure systems without sufficient authorization.

    Encryption 

    Encryption uses mathematical equations to scramble data so that they appear to be random. Only parties with the right secret key can decrypt the contents. Even if attackers can intercept the data your service sends or stores, encryption prevents them from understanding the true contents of the data without the secret key.

    All of these techniques require secrets, and they require those secrets to be stored securely. If an attacker knows the password or the decryption key, it doesn’t matter how sophisticated your authentication or encryption schemes are. 

    Let’s take a look at some best practices for managing these keys. 
    Manage Your Encryption Keys

    Just as there are questions you should ask yourself about secrets management, there are also factors to consider when you manage keys. 

    Make It Durable

    If you permanently lose a key used to encrypt data, you’ve effectively lost the data no matter how many backups you have of the encrypted bits. This situation can be especially challenging with secrets, because the usual response (make lots of backup copies!) conflicts with the first principle of secrets management, which is to keep the secret secret. You can make your keys more durable by backing them up and storing them in an additional secure location to ensure that you still have access to the keys in case one location is destroyed in a disaster. This can be performed by using the native backup options provided by your application or by using a dedicated encryption key backup system.

    Change It

    It’s best to use an automated process to change keys regularly. Doing so allows you to test your key management process of changing secrets to prevent unauthorized access. It also allows you to take action if an attacker is able to steal a secret. By changing the key, the attacker might have the data, but they would be unable to unlock it, rendering it useless. 

    Declare Cryptoperiods

    A cryptoperiod is the lifetime of a key. When you generate a key, you should declare a cryptoperiod. It’s then tracked throughout the usage of the key. For some scenarios, like transport layer security (TLS) certificates used for secure web communication, the protocol directly supports this concept, and using it as designed automatically sets a cryptoperiod expiration limit. The cryptoperiod for TLS is designated by the notBefore and notAfter fields specifying the validity period.

    When a cryptoperiod expires, copies of the key material are destroyed or rendered useless, and this process is logged. In the case of data encrypted at rest, take care to ensure the data is reencrypted with an active key or keys prior to discarding the key material. Also, once key material has reached the end of its lifetime, do not reuse it for other purposes. Be sure to generate new keys for any needs beyond the expiration date.

    Build a World-Class Omni-Channel Contact Center Workforce
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

        Explain the consumer’s expectations of service.
        Describe how emerging technologies can impact your contact center design.
        Describe the Salesforce Service Cloud Advantage.
        Discover how to use customer past experiences and feedback to transform your organization.

    Welcome to the Age of the Customer

    Customer service has evolved, and it has shattered the idea of call center business as usual.

    Today’s customers are digital and on the move. They connect to each other instantly through multiple channels, and they expect the same from the companies they deal with. Let’s look at how Service Cloud can help your call center team exceed your customers’ ever-demanding expectations.

    According to top researcher Forrester, “The ability to align products, operations, and business models to what we call a ‘customer-obsessed operating model’ will determine a company's ultimate success.” In other words, for businesses to keep customers happy and to stay competitive, you must invest in sophisticated technology that lets your contact center deliver top-notch service on every channel.
    Change Channels—and Customer Interactions

    The way in which customers contact you is always shifting: calling, emailing, texting, and so on. The shift will continue as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more commonplace. Brace yourself for AI to disrupt customer support jobs, as nonhuman interactions are on the rise. For example, with the Internet of Things (IOT), a washing machine can predict the need to purchase more detergent and instantly connect with a retailer’s app (such as Amazon Alexa) to place and confirm the order. This is not to say we don’t need service agents, but the way they interact with customers is changing fast. Human interaction will still be required on many of the customer service cases coming through your organization. But as new technology makes contacting service easier, more accessible, and instant, the overall volume of customer service interactions through multiple channels will continue to climb.
    So What’s Next?

    Agents must become experts in all customer engagement channels to make their customer interactions more personalized and, well, human. But what happens if your agents don’t have the right tools to meet the shifting demands of customers? Customer frustration can increase as brand loyalty decreases, ultimately leading to lower CSAT and NPS scores...and greater attrition.

    That’s why leading organizations understand the need for an intelligent, flexible customer service platform that can give their agents the tools to make their jobs easier, and meet the higher demands of today’s customers. And it’s why organizations are digitally transforming their customer contact centers with the Service Cloud platform.
    The Service Cloud Advantage: Connect with Connected Customers

    It’s not necessary to make things overcomplicated to offer an omnichannel experience. You can make it happen in a single platform.

    Here’s how: Service Cloud gives your agents the power to deliver service that bridges the gap from a transaction to an interaction. It’s as instant and easy as a conversation, on whatever channel your customers are using—from a single platform. Now your agents can respond in real-time to any customer, anywhere.

        Text/SMS
        Email
        Websites

    Give Agents a Single, 360-Degree Customer View

     

    Imagine this: Every single service agent can turn to their desktop and have a real-time view of a customer's entire journey with your company. And they can then use that information to offer personalized service—fast.

    The  Lightning Service Console is designed with agents in mind. And since the console is built on the Salesforce platform, your agents can access information from different systems across the company. This enables agents to access everything they need to provide quality customer service from one screen.
    Boost Agent Productivity—and Customer Happiness

     

    It’s not unusual for companies to have 10 or 20 systems that agents use to find all a customer’s information. If agents have all of that information on one screen, they can solve customers’ issues much faster, and work more efficiently. And you can boost customer satisfaction and your ROI. With the Lightning Service Console, everything an agent needs is right at their fingertips so that they can deliver:

        Faster service: Rapidly work through any backlog of cases with tools that eliminate clicks and let agents take care of customers quickly, increase customer satisfaction levels, and stay motivated by feeling agile and productive.
        Smarter service : Agents can be proactive service gurus, address inefficiencies before they happen, and feel empowered with the right information to make more informed decisions that help build lasting customer relationships.
        Personalized service : “ 68% of consumers say it’s very important for service agents to know their full history.” Regardless of channel, your agents can always know everything about your customer. Whether it’s past issues, purchase history, or data from a backend system, everything’s all in one place.

    So get ready to leapfrog the competition as you deliver on the personalized experiences your customer cares about most.
    Help Customers Help Themselves with Self-Service Sites

    Did you know that most customers prefer not to talk to a live agent? In fact, “81% of them try self-service first.” So how can you offer personalized self-service on any channel a customer chooses?

    With Service Cloud, you can create a single, branded Experience Cloud site that your customers can access to find what they need, on any device, anywhere they go. This frees agents to spend more time working on the toughest cases.

    So what about those questions going unanswered in self-service sites?

    Salesforce Experience Cloud sites integrate with Service Cloud. Customers can create cases manually, agents can escalate customer questions to cases, and managers can set workflows to escalate cases if a question hasn't been answered
    Meet Rising Customer Expectations on Every Channel

    Everyone appreciates a genuine conversation. That goes for customers, too. It’s time for service agents to ditch the call script and engage with customers with more personalized conversations.

    Research shows that the “service customers experience from your center influences the level of service they expect to experience in their next contact.” It’s important to understand what customers expect from your organization, so you can reposition the contact center to meet shifting expectations quickly and efficiently. Let’s look at how to do that.

    Best Practices for Omnichannel Call Center Success

    1. Customer service is a team sport:

        Ensure that everyone in your service organization, from agents to your management team, thoroughly understands your top 10 basic customer expectations.
        Be sure to post them prominently.

    Happy agent with headsetService Team Tip

    Have your service center management memorize the list of top 10

    customer expectations, and make a habit of considering them when

    making decisions.

    2. Don’t guess what customers want. Go straight to the source: the customer.

        Create services based on what customers really expect.
        Then listen to customer interactions with agents and social channels. Take frequent and detailed surveys to get insight on how you’re meeting the team’s 10 expectations.

    Happy agent with headsetService Team Tip

    Consider posting a scorecard based on customer feedback to keep

    managers and agents up to date on changing customer expectations.

    3. Exceed expectations.

        Steve Jobs said, “Customers don’t usually know what they want until you show it to them.” Go beyond the status quo and give customers more than what they ask for, and differentiate your brand through service.
        Transform your call center now to get a jump-start on the future.

    to learn how Salesforce can help predict what a customer needs before
    they ask for it.

    4. Build cross-functional teams.

        Make customer service a team sport by serving customers across your organization.
        Use your company’s combined information, support, processes, products, and services to meet and exceed customer expectations.

    Happy agent with headsetManagement Tip
    Use Salesforce Experience Cloud sites within your own organization to keep
    everyone connected and engaged across divisions. This better supports
    your service organization.

    5. Let your customers guide your strategy.

        Ensure that the evolving customer expectations are central to how you approach your customer relationships.
        Enable your customers to drive everything, including segmentation, the channels you make available, service-level objectives, your hours of operation, and more.

        Explain how to hire the right service agents.
        Explain how to motivate, train, and boost agent morale.
        List what to look for when assessing agent performance and how to give effective feedback.

    Turn Customer Service Agents into Agents of Change

    Turnover statistics at most call centers reveal a truly scary picture, with plenty of effort and training dollars wasted, as experienced agents jump ship for better opportunities. Want to figure out how to stop wasting time and money? Here’s a step-by-step guide to implement a strong digital contact center hiring and onboarding program.
    Step One: Hire the Right Agents

    Service agent talks to customer on the phone

    If you want to offer exceptional customer service, start by transforming your hiring process. Improving the hiring process boosts the overall performance of your operation and customer service, while cutting the cost of providing that service. So now you’re ready to hire stellar agents. Let’s examine the most important qualities to look for in every new hire, as outlined by  Kevin Hegebarth, an expert in customer service and hiring excellent candidates.

        Technical knowledge: They have a solid understanding for the industry and basic resolution skills.
        Ability to multitask: They must thrive in a hectic environment and be able to jump from one issue to another quickly.
        Pleasant phone etiquette: Candidates must have the ability to engage with customers in a pleasant manner and be able to hold a fluid conversation.
        Ability to stay calm, cool, and collected: They’re able to remain calm and resourceful in any situation, regardless of the circumstances.
        Ability to focus: They have the ability to stay present and focused on delivering the best possible service to each and every customer.
        Solution-oriented thinkers: They display a high level of confidence and a propensity to search for a resolution themselves or direct their customers to the appropriate personnel who can provide an answer.
        Ability to listen and put the customer first: They can use empathy and patience to ensure customers feel catered to and confident that the support representative is hearing their issue and is knowledgeable in the subject matter.

    Step Two: Build a Winning Agent Team

    As more people are doing business online, your customer service team is increasingly becoming the center of business growth. Kevin Hegebarth suggests four strategies you can use to build your winning agent workforce.

    Four Key Strategies for Hiring Success 


    Decorative image of a birdThe Early Bird Gets the Worm

    The competition for qualified agent labor is fierce. Make a decision quickly for the best chance to snag the best talent in your market. Applicants are more likely to accept job offers that are made quickly. And that timely hiring decision tends to have a positive effect on the prospective employee’s performance once on the job.

    Decorative image of a notification bell icon Let Candidates Know

    According to a 2013 national survey by CareerBuilder, over 75% of applicants never hear anything from a hiring company. Zero. Zilch. Nothing. Yet, 82% of them expect some kind of response, even a simple “thanks, but no thanks.” Don’t let your hiring process become a black hole. Responding to each application helps bolster your brand perception on company review sites and leads to more promising candidates.

    Decorative image of hands interlockedGet Everyone Involved

    Record applicant interviews and share the most promising candidates with key colleagues to ensure correct hiring decisions are made. It also helps calibrate the recruiting team—in much the same way as your quality assurance teams are calibrated—so that each candidate is evaluated consistently.

    Decorative image of crystal ballUse Your Crystal Ball (Sort Of)

    It takes a lot of time and money hiring each new agent, which is wasted if the new hire doesn’t work out. Big data and predictive analytics can help identify stellar candidates and minimize the risk of a bad hire. Predictive analytics compares the tenure and performance of successful agents with data collected about them during their hiring process. This comparison gives you a data-driven model that can help you evaluate new applicants. If candidates fit the model, they generally perform well against the key metrics of the organization. Move them to the top of your list for hiring consideration.
    Step Three: Keep Your Agents Motivated

    Customer service agent works at her desk.

    So you’ve found the right talent, and built your team. Now you’ve arrived at one of the most important steps of all: Invest in your employees. Rewarding agents when they go beyond their job description helps retain top talent.

    Remember, happy agents = happy customers. To keep your agents happy, you’ve got to equip them with tools to succeed in their job. Agents who feel supported are more invested in their jobs, and they’re more proactive, productive, and most importantly, more pleasant to customers.

    So where to start? According to David Bethers, “fun incentive programs are an easy way to motivate and build team collaboration, while making employees feel rewarded for a job well done. But you also need a plan. These five ways can help agents make a successful career out of customer service.”

        New skills: Offer training in digital, social media, and mobile apps and emerging channels.
        New motivations: Empower agents to make decisions, highlight agent diversity hiring practices.
        New work rules: Give high-performing agents more autonomy that can lead to future positions, offer schedule flexibility, and encourage collaboration within the team.
        New metrics: Take another look at agent retention, offer role extensions and paths to promotions.
        New career paths: Introduce opportunities for agents to migrate to another department in your organization, such as Marketing, Digital Content, Social Media, or Sales.

    Step Four: Deliver Constructive Feedback on Agent Performance

    There are lots of factors that can affect an agent’s performance. As we all know, the contact center can be a stressful place. Agent stress can trigger customer stress, and customer stress can trigger agent stress. If you see an issue escalating on the floor, be sure to talk to your agents to help them recognize and diffuse their stress triggers.

    Next, be sure to design the performance conversations in advance and communicate with your agents about how they are assessed. Create an open dialogue established to understand what tools and continued training your agents require to perform at their best.

    Finally, deliver constructive and consistent feedback designed to improve agent performance and be clear about how you can support them and their growth aspirations. These steps can go far to ensure that agents earn your respect and trust and that they’re set up for continued success within your organization.

        Describe key features of the Flosum platform structure.
        Identify the typical steps of the development flow within the Flosum platform.

    Note

    Flosum’s Platform Structure

    Salesforce admins and developers know that finding a tool that helps them manage changes across the entire development lifecycle is no easy task. Many DevSecOps (development, security, operations) tools are siloed, which makes visibility and collaboration between teams a real struggle. And still others are not suited for the unique needs of the Salesforce Platform. 

    To deliver speedy, secure, and successful Salesforce releases, companies need a solution that streamlines processes, helps them quickly and easily identify and remedy code issues, keeps orgs in sync, and protects and preserves the integrity of customer data. 

    Flosum is a complete, end-to-end solution for Salesforce DevSecOps that allows developers and operations teams to orchestrate changes throughout the development lifecycle. Because it’s built on Salesforce and uses the Salesforce interface, Flosum doesn’t need to access or move data elsewhere. 

    The Flosum platform offers user-story management, built-in merge tools, version control, continuous deployments, static code analysis, regression-testing solutions, and more. 

    Let’s explore Flosum’s structure through the elements of its navigation.  

    Navigation Tab
    	

    Functionality

    Home Tab
    	

    Displays the Kanban board and SwimLanes, which let users track all stories, branches, and components; users can define and track promotion paths and manage all their work at the organizational level.

    Orgs Tab
    	

    Shows users the various orgs that are connected to Flosum, the high-level details of changes that have been made or deployed in each org, code coverage, the audit trail for each org, and more

    Comparison Tab
    	

    Lets users compare different orgs to each other or compare an org to a branch or even to a repository or source

    Branches, Source, and Commits Tabs 
    	

    Give users access to the native version control functionality built entirely within Flosum, which they can use independently or integrate with other version control systems

    Peer Reviews Tab
    	

    Allows users to merge the code of different branches and facilitate a peer code review 

    Pipelines Tab
    	

    Lets users define pipelines to automate and execute each step of the development process as code gets deployed upstream, or use pipelines for back promotions 

    SwimLanes Tab
    	

    Lets users view SwimLanes in the Kanban board

    Dashboard Tab
    	

    Gives users the ability to view all of the reports, dashboards, and key performance indicator (KPI) metrics for the platform stored within Salesforce custom objects; users can use standard reporting or manipulate their reporting with another tool such as Salesforce CRM Analytics to reflect their business needs. 

    Settings Tab
    	

    Allows users to control all of the settings in the Flosum platform (system admins only)

    Flosum also helps teams connect all of their sandboxes, test orgs, and production environments to create a super-smooth development flow. Let’s get into it.
    Flosum’s Development Flow

    Ready to go with the flow? Here are the basic steps of development that the developer completes using the Flosum platform:

        Creates a branch.
        Commits components to the branch.
        Ties a user story to the branch.
        Makes a request for peer code review.
        Merges the various branches into a release branch.
        Uses Overwrite Protection to review and resolve any merge conflicts.
        Deploys the release branch to testing orgs and then to production.
        Commits their changes to the Flosum repository. The Flosum platform automatically deploys those changes to the production org and back-deploys to all sandboxes so that they remain in sync.

    Note

    This flow represents the “best practice” for development; keep in mind that the Flosum platform is flexible, so teams can use it in many ways and adapt it to their needs.

    Now that you’re familiar with the platform’s features and flow, it’s time to break down the first six development steps. Head on over to the next unit to prepare for deployment.

        Describe creating a branch.
        Summarize steps for committing components and tying a user story to a branch.
        List the benefits of making a request for peer code review.
        Explain merging branches.
        Identify how Overwrite Protection helps users detect and resolve code conflicts.

    Creating a Branch

    In Flosum, a branch is an independent line of development that allows developers and Salesforce administrators to work in parallel with other team members while keeping their changes separate from the rest of the team’s changes. 

    A branch is a separate part of—but connected to—a developer’s repository. A repository can contain multiple branches, and these branches can be merged into the repository when necessary.

    Flosum supports many types of branches, including:

        Feature branches: A feature branch consists of a user story containing each of the features being developed for that user story. (One feature per feature branch is recommended.)
        Release branches: After the feature branches move through quality assurance (QA), they are merged into a release branch. A release branch will hold the various feature branches until they’re ready to be pushed to production.

    Committing Components and Tying a User Story to a Branch

    After a developer has created a branch and tied a user story to the branch, they can modify the components in a development sandbox and add those components to a particular branch. 

    Flosum automatically detects the components that have been changed in the development sandbox and shows the details of each component, when it was changed, who changed it, the component type, and the component’s name. 

    Users have the option to filter and select components by type and to search components by name. (Flosum supports all component types that Salesforce supports, whether it’s metadata API or tooling API.)

    Note

    At this point in the flow, Flosum will run a code quality scan. Read more about this process here. 

    Once a developer is assigned a user story, they can tie it to a branch in Flosum using Jira, ServiceNow, Azure DevOps, or another application lifecycle management (ALM) tool. For example, the user could search for a Jira ticket within the branch and append it to the branch. 
    Making a Request for Peer Code Review

    When a developer submits a request, they’re asking that one or more of their team members complete a code review of a branch. 

    Developers should ask for a code review before merging into shared branches, deploying to an org, or committing code to a repository. Making requests for peer code review:

        Increases communication among team members who are working on shared components.
        Informs team members about changes that have occurred.
        Results in higher quality deployments.

    Merging Branches

    The next step is merging the various user stories or branches that each developer is working on into a release branch. When a user merges branches, Flosum will show the conflicts between both branches or user stories that the user is choosing to merge. The user is then able to resolve the conflicts.  
    Using Overwrite Protection

    With the Overwrite Protection feature (formerly known as “Impact Analysis”), users can compare their deployments and their target orgs to detect and resolve code conflicts. The main purpose of this feature is to prevent any changes on the org from being overwritten unintentionally. 

    Users can complete these predeployment operations efficiently through Flosum platform’s seamless integration with Salesforce. Now we’re ready to dive into deployment. You’ll learn all about it in the next unit.

    Deploy a Release Branch to Production
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe deploying a release branch.
        Identify how pipelines automate development processes.
        Summarize how users track and manage the dev process with the Kanban board and SwimLanes.

    Deploying a Release Branch

    All deployments are done from the branch records within Flosum. A user can deploy a release branch in one of two ways:

        Manually: Users execute a standard deployment where they select the org and push the components out to the org.
        Via Pipelines: Users configure the steps ahead of time and execute them automatically. (We will discuss more about this later.)

    When a user attempts to execute a deployment, it shows the deployment history at the top of the Deploy tab. 

    The Flosum Deploy tab

    There, users can see:

        The deployment name.
        The changes that have been made.
        Destructive changes (the removal of components from an org).

    Users also can view the metadata logs of deployment, including:

        How many components were successfully deployed.
        Which components passed.
        Which components failed.

    Under other tabs within Deploy, users can see the following information and more:

        Which Jira stories were deployed (Jira)
        Who approved them (Approval History)
        Which components were changed (Manifest)

    Note

    After a developer commits their changes to the Flosum repository, the Flosum platform automatically deploys those changes to the production org and back-deploys to all sandboxes so they remain in sync. 
    Using Pipelines

    A pipeline allows a user to define and automate the exact series of steps they want executed in the development process. 

    Users can automate four different actions:

        Validations
        Deployments
        Rollbacks
        Webhook calls

    Pipelines perform these actions in a series of steps, and include dependent steps based on whether the preceding action has passed or failed. Pipelines also let users select the tests they want to run (for example, specified tests, included tests, or all test options).

    Let’s look at an example. Suppose a user has a feature branch that has been approved and is going to use a pipeline to deploy into the integrated development environment (IDE). If the validation is successful, it will deploy to the QA org. If the deployment is successful, it will complete the regression testing on the QA org. If the regression testing is successful, it will take that particular branch and promote it to the production org. If a deployment fails at any point along the way, it does not proceed to the next step. 
    Tracking and Managing the Development Process

    The Kanban board on the Flosum Home tab shows where each user story sits in the development process in real time.

    The Flosum Home tab

    Users can see how many components are in a branch, how many errors were found, and other details. Users also can select any time frame in the Branches Updated drop-down menu to view changes within that time frame.

    The SwimLanes tab lets users configure the order or their operations and processes.

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe how benefit schedule, benefit session, and benefit disbursement records work together to track your work.
        Enroll a participant in a program. 

    Note

    Salesforce offers Salesforce for Nonprofits, which includes integrated platform solutions and managed packages. This module provides information about Nonprofit Cloud for Programs, a platform solution. For information about managed package products, see Manage Your Mission with Program Management Module in Trailhead. If you’re not sure which solution your organization uses, check with your Salesforce administrator.
    Before You Start

    Before you start this module, consider completing the following recommended content.

        Programs and Benefits in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs 

    Increase Insights and Impact

    When you report on your mission, you likely report high-level totals: the number of people served by a program or the amount of a particular benefit you delivered in a year.

    As you know, those high-level numbers are made up of many small moments. Each class your team leads, every one-on-one counseling session, every meal distributed—it all adds up.

    In this module, you learn about those individual events, which are recorded as benefit disbursement records in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs.

    A nonprofit distributes meals after a natural disaster

    Nonprofit Cloud for Programs is an integrated Salesforce platform solution to give you the insights, collaboration, and efficiency tools to increase your impact. It helps nonprofit organizations like yours define, plan, deliver, and track programs and the benefits they provide—then connect the dots to make real-time decisions about how to improve your work.

    In this unit, we start by discussing some of those dots: The objects and records you use to track your work.
    Understand Schedules and Ad Hoc Benefit Deliveries

    The highest-level data in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs are program records, which track the thematic areas of your work. Each program can have many related benefit records, which track what your nonprofit provides to participants and recipients. If you haven’t set up your programs and benefits, start with the Programs and Benefits in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs badge.

    To track a program participant’s eligibility for benefits—like 12 classes or 5 hours of counseling—you use benefit assignment records to account for your benefit disbursements.

    Then, when you provide those benefits, you track that activity with a benefit disbursement record. Benefit disbursements store information about a service, like when it was provided and how much was given. You can measure your benefit disbursements in time, money, goods, or some other criteria.

    You’ll likely create many, many benefit disbursement records. So, Nonprofit Cloud for Programs helps you create and manage benefit disbursements in two ways: by scheduling them in advance and by creating them as needed when they occur.

    You use benefit schedule records to create disbursements for planned sessions. A benefit schedule helps you create one or more benefit sessions, to which you can add participants, track attendance, and efficiently create benefit disbursement records.

    A schedule can be one-time, recurring on a regular schedule, or include many sessions scheduled irregularly. When you create a benefit schedule, a benefit session record is automatically created for every occurrence in the benefit schedule if it’s recurring.

    If you offer a benefit that doesn’t have planned participation—such as a walk-in service or disaster relief—you can create ad-hoc benefit disbursements as needed. You review all of these different scenarios in this module.
    Want to Get Hands-on with Nonprofit Cloud?

    In this module, we show you the steps to manage attendance and benefit disbursements in Nonprofit Cloud. We don’t have any hands-on challenges in this module, but if you want to practice and try out the steps, register for a free Nonprofit Cloud trial org with sample data. A regular Trailhead Playground doesn’t have Nonprofit Cloud or our sample data. Here’s how to get the free trial edition now.

        Sign up for a free 30-day Nonprofit Cloud trial org.
        Fill out the form.
        Click Submit. A confirmation message appears.
        When you receive the activation email (this might take a few minutes), open it and click Verify Account.
        Complete your registration by setting your password and challenge question. Tip: Save your username, password, and login URL in a secure place—such as a password manager—for easy access later. 

    Your Nonprofit Cloud trial org is ready.
    Enroll a Program Participant

    First, you must know how to enroll a participant in a program. You track this relationship with the Program Enrollment object. 

    Note

    If you work with individuals, you might call the people you serve clients, students, guests, or something more specific. You might also serve animals or other organizations. We use the term participant here to refer to anyone—or anything—enrolled in your programs and benefits. We use the term recipient for those people who receive a benefit but aren't enrolled, such as an anonymous recipient.

    Program enrollments can be related to either contact or account records by default. Your person accounts for individuals appear in list views and search as both contacts and accounts, and organizations appear as only accounts. See Stakeholder Management in Nonprofit Cloud in Trailhead for details about person accounts.

    In this badge, you follow along with Hunger No More International (HNMI), a nonprofit working to end hunger and promote healthy food options globally by providing access to nutritious meals, education, and resources. You complete the same steps as Luke Richardson, an HNMI program manager for the organization’s nutrition education work who ensures that program’s effectiveness.

    Luke starts by adding a participant to one of HNMI’s programs by creating a program enrollment record. This example follows the standard process—yours may be different depending on what’s required to enroll a participant in a particular program. Work with your admin to create a custom enrollment process to fit your needs.

        Find and select Program Management from the App Launcher (https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/attendance-and-benefit-tracking-in-nonprofit-cloud-for-programs/get-to-know-enrollments-and-deliveries/images/7f466b2024fe866364fcf6479295829a_kix.irhs15to6v1.jpg).
        Select the All Programs list view.
        Select the Nutrition Education program from the list view.
        Click Add Participants.
        In the flow, select Contacts to add person accounts to the program. You can also select a list view to further filter the results.

        Find and select participants from the list. You can add as many as 20 participants to a program at once. Select Alex Brown.
        Save your work. 

    A program enrollment record for the Nutrition Education program

    If your organization wants to track a set of participants as they move through a program together—such as everyone who starts a program in a particular month—group their program enrollments using the Program Cohort object. See Manage Program Cohorts and Cohort Members in Salesforce Help for details.

    Now that you know about the objects you use and have enrolled a program participant, you can dive in to benefit disbursements and benefit schedules in the next unit.

    Get Started with Einstein Generative AI
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe the core capabilities of generative AI.
        Describe how Einstein incorporates the power of generative AI. 

    AI in the Spotlight

    Over the past decade we've witnessed artificial intelligence (AI) steadily improve at doing things we once thought only humans could do. This has led us to imagine a futuristic world with AI, but one that's still years away. Or so we thought. In early 2023 ChatGPT burst onto the scene, showing the world that the future is already here. Suddenly, AI is responding to complex questions with equally complex answers that sound as if they were written by a human. And because ChatGPT was released for anyone to use, people experienced first-hand how well it could hold a natural-sounding conversation. It has surprised and delighted, and sparked our imaginations yet again. It’s also raised questions about what it means for the future of work.

    In this Quick Look badge, you learn about GPT and how it fits into the larger concept of generative AI. Then, you'll learn how Einstein is the world’s first generative AI for CRM.
    GPT’s Predictive Power

    Okay, let's get this out of the way: GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which means a lot to AI researchers but not so much to you and me. Let's just stick with GPT and focus on what it does.

    At a high level, GPT is an AI tool that has been trained to write like we humans do. All it needs is a starting point in the form of a question, request, or even just the beginning of a sentence. And then it continues the thread to create paragraphs of text that are similar to something a real person would write. ChatGPT is a version of GPT that has been fine-tuned to better understand the intention of our instructions, and respond accordingly. You can even tell it to write in a certain style, whether it's poetry, a programming language, or as a pirate. For example, let's see what happens when you ask it to summarize the moon landing in pirate-speak:

    "Ahoy there! Avast ye, matey! 'Tis a tale o' adventure on the high seas o' space!

    Back in the year o' our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, a band o' brave sailors from the land o' America set sail on a quest to reach the moon. They be Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, and they be on a mission from NASA to land on the moon and plant the stars and stripes flag."

    It continues from there, completing the tale in the same silly vernacular.

    So how does it generate such convincing text? OpenAI, the creators of GPT, used a ridiculous amount of computing power to train it. They had it read millions of web pages to learn what words are used near each other, and how they're used together. That made GPT really good at predicting the next word of a sentence by using context. So, imagine you're asked to fill in the blank: "In conversations, my partner and I finish each other's _______." You're likely to choose the word "sentences," and so is GPT. But if you change the context a little: "In restaurants, my partner and I finish each other's _______." There's a better chance you would fill the blank with "sandwiches." Same with GPT.

    GPT writes paragraphs that follow a thread by making an educated guess at each new word in a sentence. It's way better than your phone's predictive text, which if used in the same way only gives you bizarre sentences that make for funny internet memes.

    GPT's ability to write coherent text falls into a broader category of AI known as generative AI. This includes AI tools that can create things like images or audio. As computing power increases, and research continues, generative AI will get better at creating work that’s convincingly human-made. It probably won’t be long before generative AI is part of your everyday life.
    A Future with Generative AI

    The arrival of mainstream generative AI has raised a lot of questions about the future of work. People wonder if they'll be replaced with AI. They're concerned about the ethical use of a tool that essentially impersonates humans. They’re skeptical about the quality of what generative AI produces. Obviously, AI must be handled with care.

    Salesforce knows it's critical to establish principles for the ethical use of AI technology. And for the last 6 years, we've had an AI ethics group developing these principles. So when we launch new AI technology, we can help our customers navigate these difficult waters to do the business of business smarter and fairer. Check out the resources section to learn more.

    Our latest AI technology brings the incredible power of generative AI to Einstein and the Salesforce Platform.

    Einstein is built right into Salesforce, so it can use your own data to custom-tailor everything it generates to your unique business. And since Einstein is available across the entire Einstein 1 platform, it's there to improve every customer experience.

    We also recognize that the world of generative AI includes more than just ChatGPT. So we've designed Einstein to allow connections to other language models, such as Anthropic's Claude. This lets you "bring your own model" thanks to APIs and an open ecosystem of generative AI partners.

    Einstein is here to empower your business with amazing generative AI capabilities, using your data and your models for your experiences.

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe what a Salesforce business scenario is.
        Explain the benefits of using a Salesforce business scenario.
        Identify what’s included in a Salesforce business scenario.

    What Are Business Scenarios?

    We are in the middle of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Companies must adapt to this hyperconnected world and delight customers who are demanding more personalized experiences. But how do you get started? While Salesforce has incredible technology that can power these customer-centric experiences, it’s not always easy to figure out how to tie all of our solutions into your particular business needs.

    To help you get started on your digital transformation journey, we have bundled our best content into common use cases. Business scenarios describe tangible, real-world use cases and offer flexible options to help you bridge the gap between your organization’s current business capabilities and the solutions needed to achieve your goals. For each scenario, you discover a variety of Salesforce solutions to help you meet your business objectives, reduce time to value, and even let you plan out longer-term implementation roadmaps. Business scenarios also highlight the platform-agnostic business capabilities that an organization, business, department, or team needs to successfully execute these objectives. Understanding what business capabilities are needed to implement a scenario can help align cross-functional teams around areas for investment, better strategize around technology solutions, and even help expose growth opportunities for team members.
    What’s Included in a Business Scenario?

    We’ve created a set of solutions, spanning any number of products, that map to various business scenarios. These are presented at increasing levels of complexity and come from a variety of trusted sources including Trailhead, Help, and Solution Kits. Included are solutions that most closely relate to your organization’s objectives. Each solution considers maturity requirements in terms of people and process, as well as business capability recommendations and best practices

    For example, the Data-Driven Advertising Business Scenario outlines a business scenario that exceeds customer expectations by delivering personalized advertising across all of a customer’s devices in a secure, privacy-compliant manner. In order to understand your customer you need to start with data. Delve into your data to develop a deeper understanding of your target shoppers, reach new levels of personalization, and increase audience reach with secure, targeted campaigns.

    Each business scenario includes the following.

        Recommended products: Products that can help you deliver data-driven advertising.
        Curated solutionsfrom trusted sources, such as Trailhead and Help & Training documents.

    o   Beginner solutions are typically out-of-box capabilities that enable quick time to value.

    o   Intermediate solutions require integration and custom work.

    o   Advanced solutions are typically complex use cases that require a lot of work.

        Business capabilities: Best practices to grow your maturity and develop considerations for the solution implementation.
        Resources: Additional resources or business scenarios that support implementing the solution.

    How to Use a Business Scenario 

    The business scenario answers the “what” and helps an architect or line of business manager understand which business capabilities are recommended, which products they need to consider as part of the solutions, and a curated set of solutions designed to meet these needs.

    These business scenarios provide you with the best practices and guidance on selecting the right solutions and products for your organization. Follow these steps to get started using business scenarios.

        Review business capabilities required to achieve the business scenario.
        Assess the maturity levels of your organization’s business capabilities.
        Review the best practices with minimum maturity level to understand how your business can improve in each area of capability.
        Review products and solutions to achieve faster time to value and build a roadmap as you increase your maturity.

    Get to Know Cybersecurity Risk Management
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe the goals of a cybersecurity risk management program.
        Explain the importance of managing cybersecurity risks. 

    What Is Cybersecurity Risk Management?

    Your company just closed a deal to use a new cloud computing service. Whoopee! This new technology makes it easier to automate application development and bring new opportunities. But let’s pause for a moment. Have you considered the potential impact if the data processed by this new technology is compromised by an attacker? Have you thought about the risks?

    This is where cybersecurity risk management comes into play. Cybersecurity risk management is the process of managing risks associated with digital business assets. It involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s assets. As a cybersecurity risk manager you strive to improve visibility into risks at the enterprise, business unit, and system-level, in order to strengthen an organization’s cyber resilience. Cyber resilience refers to an organization’s ability to prevent, detect, respond, and recover from cyber threats. In a world of constant change, new cyber risks and threats arise daily. You enable their organization to respond to events in a timely way, in order to minimize business disruption and financial losses. Suffice to say, it’s a pretty important role!

    So, going back to our example at the beginning, how do you, as a cyber risk manager, identify the risks of using the new cloud computing service? To begin with, you need to consider the likelihood that known threats exploit vulnerabilities. For example, is there sensitive customer data stored in the cloud that an attacker would be interested in stealing? Are there known vulnerabilities in the applications running in the cloud that would allow an attacker to access the information? What is the potential financial, operational, and reputational impact on your company if such a breach occurs? How likely is it that this scenario actually happens? These are the types of questions a risk manager thinks about every day.

    Note

    A vulnerability is defined as the state of being exposed to the possibility of attack. In cybersecurity this can be a flaw in an application’s code that lets an attacker change the behavior of the application and steal sensitive information.

    Once the risk of a certain program, system, or technology is identified, the organization takes actions to protect itself from the risk. Imagine you are buying health insurance. When you have health insurance, you do not have to worry as much about the cost of your healthcare bills. If you have an accident, you know you can get good quality care and recover quickly. When you choose your insurance plan, you carefully consider the benefits and costs of each plan in order to decide on the one that best suits your healthcare needs. In the same way, as a cybersecurity risk manager, you compare the costs and benefits of mitigating cyber risk by implementing protections, and advising the organization to implement the best action plan.

    Image of a person comparing two healthcare plans surrounded by tools for managing risk, such as a calculator, money, stethoscope, thermometer, pills, and a prescription.

    Just like purchasing insurance reduces the risk associated with accidents, managing cyber risk “buys down” the potential impact if data is compromised by an attacker. Although it’s impossible to fully eliminate all risk, managing cyber risk minimizes the likelihood that an attacker can exploit a vulnerability. If an attacker is successful in breaching a system, risk management can still minimize business disruption and financial losses, so the organization can get back to business faster. 
    The Importance of Managing Cyber Risks

    As your organization acquires new technology assets and becomes ever more connected, the threats to your customer’s and your business’ data expand as well. It’s time to put a plan in place to deliver the right amount of cyber protections, so your customers know that they can trust your organization to secure their information. Managing cyber risks means making conscious decisions about securing sensitive information.

    As a cyber risk manager, you work to make risk identification and evaluation easier, so everyone, from your boss to your customers, understands the organization’s tolerance for risk, and the actions and associated costs necessary to manage it. Although managing cybersecurity risk can’t ensure that you always make the correct decisions, it does ensure that everyone understands who is responsible for managing a given risk to acceptable levels.

    Every organization is unique when it comes to risk and how much it’s willing to take on. But managing cyber risks is an activity that is important for small and large organizations, around the world in every industry, from finance to healthcare to government to energy. Smaller companies may outsource risk management functions to a third party. You may be in charge of working with one of these vendors. Or you may even work for a company that sells cybersecurity risk management services. As a member of the cyber risk management team in a larger organization, you may need to work with many teams across the enterprise to holistically understand risk, including integrating with the Enterprise Risk Management Team.

    Cybersecurity Risk Manager Responsibilities

    Are you a great analyzer, influencer, and problem solver? Do you enjoy understanding threats and analyzing data to better understand risk? Do you like to come up with action-oriented improvement plans? If so, managing cybersecurity risks can be the perfect job for you!

    Let’s meet David. He is a cybersecurity risk manager at a cybersecurity services company. David identifies and analyzes risks facing the organization and its systems, and then he prioritizes the most likely and impactful cybersecurity risks. He understands threats and challenges facing the organization, and gathers and uses data to assess risks to the business. His goal is to enable business system owners, executives, and other stakeholders to make risk-informed decisions to manage risks at an acceptable level.

    David has a challenging but pivotal role. It’s his job to try to mitigate risks by working with key stakeholders and leadership to lessen the likelihood and impact of a given risk. 

    In doing so, David has to balance risks and rewards, much like someone carefully balances while walking across a tightrope. His company faces many threats to its valuable systems and data, such as denial of service attacks from malicious actors who want to overwhelm his servers so that his customers cannot access them. He also has a limited amount of financial, staff, and technological resources to address the risks posed by these threats. Once he has worked with partners to identify the most likely and highly impactful risks, it’s his job to help the organization prioritize risks in a logical way. 

    A person balances on a tightrope using a pole with a scale holding a shield on one end, and a vulnerability bug on the other.

    David likes understanding how all the pieces of the risk puzzle in his organization fit together. He researches frameworks applicable to his given industry and uses them to assess the current protections and provide opportunities for improvements, in order to manage risks to an acceptable level. He also works with teams across the business to help them improve their risk posture. He makes sure each part of the organization understands its role in managing risk. Once he and his partners have assessed their risk and current protections, he advises system owners on the implementation of technical controls to help mitigate risk, and documents risk decisions for the organization. 

    Note

    As a risk manager you are not responsible for implementing technical controls yourself, or for eliminating all risks facing the enterprise. Rather you work with system owners to prioritize high impact, likely risks for remediation and advise on mitigation strategies. 

    David is like a detective who constantly searches for clues about the current risk posture of his company. Once mitigations have been put in place, he gathers data to help monitor the organization’s risk posture, and forms close relationships across the business to validate and assess the risk posture accurately. He has his finger on the pulse of the organization's risk posture at any given moment, and recognizes problems early. His work is never done, and he evolves his strategy for managing risk as the threat and technology landscapes evolve. 
    Cybersecurity Risk Manager Skills

    So, like David, you’re ready to understand the threats against organizations and figure out how to thwart them in order to buy-down risk. What skills do you need to land your dream job? 

    First, it helps to have a bachelor’s degree. Your degree doesn’t have to be in a specific area, but risk managers often have an educational background in computers, information science, engineering, systems analysis, information technology, cybersecurity, or even accounting. There are also certifications you can pursue to bolster your security skills, including the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), or Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) certifications, to name a few. 

    In terms of technical skills, as a cybersecurity risk manager you are a great analyzer, who understands cybersecurity and technology, systems management, and project management. You have skills in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, threat modeling, and scenario analysis. Risk modeling is another great skill to have, even if you’ve practiced it in another industry, such as finance.

    Technical skills help you as a risk manager understand and solve security problems, but you must also have business know-how. You use your influence and persuasion skills to advise on decisions with significant organizational impact. You are a great communicator who enjoys collaborating to get things done and advocate for security best practices. You like building trust and consensus across organizational teams, and you are both detail-oriented and think strategically to solve problems. 

    Finally, as a cybersecurity risk manager, you have a passion for researching, analyzing, and applying different regulatory and policy frameworks to help your organization meet industry standards in an efficient manner. Some of the most common frameworks you should be familiar with are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, and ISO/IEC 27001/2 Information Technology standards, although there are many more to learn about!

    Before You Start

    If you completed Get Started with Application Security, then you already know how to protect networks and prevent network attacks. Now let’s talk about how to use a web application firewall (WAF) to defend your application perimeter from malicious traffic. 
    What Is WAF Security?

    According to Cloudflare, a WAF creates a shield between a web application and the internet; this shield can help mitigate many common attacks. It helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic between a web application and the internet.

    Just as a tollbooth allows paying customers to drive across a toll road, and prevents nonpaying customers from accessing the roadway, network traffic must pass through a firewall, before it’s allowed to reach a server. WAFs use adaptable policies to defend against vulnerabilities in a web application, allowing for easy policy modification, and faster response to new attack vectors. 

    A toll booth on a highway allows paying cars through and blocks nonpaying cars.

    A WAF defends applications from malicious traffic. While other security solutions, such as traditional firewalls, mostly work based on ports and protocols, a WAF has to understand and examine the application layer traffic. A WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as:

        Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Also known as Sea Surf or Session Riding, this is an attack vector that tricks a web browser into executing unwanted actions in applications logged into by the user. This attack can result in unauthorized fund transfers, changed passwords, and data theft.
        Cross-site scripting (XSS): An attack that tricks a web browser into running malicious code. That malicious code can be inserted in several ways. Often, it is either added to the end of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or posted directly onto a page that displays user-generated content.
        File inclusion: An attack technique in which hackers trick a web application into running or exposing files on a server. If this occurs, sensitive information could be exposed and in some cases lead to XSS and other damaging attacks.
        Structured Query Language (SQL) injection: An attack that surfaces as a result of malicious code being plugged into an unsuspecting database. With this technique attackers can access information that was not intended to be seen by the public, such as private customer details or company data, which is highly detrimental toward a business’s interests.
        Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): An attack that disrupts normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. It uses multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

    A WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic. The value of a WAF comes in part from the speed and ease with which application security engineers can implement policy modification, allowing for faster response to the above attack types.

    In other words, a WAF is one of the tools responsible for securing business-critical web apps from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10, zero-day threats, known or unknown application vulnerabilities, and an array of other web application layer attacks that can impact your organization.

    As organizations undergo new digital initiatives, their attack surface may expand as they enable new business. As a result, they often find that new web applications and application programming interfaces (APIs) become exposed to dangerous traffic due to web server vulnerabilities, a server plugin, or other issues exploited by threats that aim to disrupt organizations. WAFs help to keep these applications and the content they access secure.
    Why WAFs Are Critical for Organizations

    Organizations increasingly use web application technologies as part of digital innovation (DI) efforts. As a result, organizations require a fundamental change in the way they conduct business using digital technology. DI means that you have more web applications touching more critical and sensitive data. Organizations that can protect their web applications can move faster, and can put new capabilities into the hands of their users more quickly, and more securely.

    For organizations to successfully implement DI efforts, they need to do more than simply deploy technologies. They also need to focus on the needs of customers, and be willing to embrace rapid change, including rapid adoption and technology deployment options to meet the needs of customers.

    Organizations can use public cloud and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions to accelerate their businesses, but they must protect them with strict security rules. As organizations rapidly adopt these technologies, the speed of business operations also increases, and web application security flaws arise, leaving web applications at risk from threats hiding in internet traffic.

    As customers increasingly access business applications using unknown bring your own devices (BYOD) on networks that are not controlled with virtual private network (VPN) access, organizations should recognize the risks. Even network firewalls can be vulnerable. Traditional perimeter application security tools are not adequate for protecting internet-facing applications from OWASP Top 10 dangers and other application vulnerabilities found in network traffic.

    Organizations need a new set of rules and tools to defend business-critical applications– WAF is a solution that protects these applications and data.
    What Types of Threats Do WAFs Prevent?

    Modern web applications require a comprehensive WAF to protect important applications against multiple types of web attacks and other threats lurking in network traffic. 

    The OWASP Top 10 “represents a broad consensus about the most critical application security threats to web applications.” Attackers often leverage these threats to target critical network appliances. The OWASP Top 10 includes:

    Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
    	

    Description

    1. Broken access control
    	

    When user access and restrictions are not enforced, unauthorized users can potentially access confidential files.

    2. Cryptographic failures
    	

    Since many web applications and APIs lack data security, attackers can exploit sensitive financial, healthcare, and personal information.

    3. Injection
    	

    When untrusted data is sent to an interpreter, an attacker can inject malicious code. What’s more, when an application includes untrusted data without validation, cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws occur that can be used to perform attacks.

    4. Insecure Design
    	

    Risks exist related to design flaws. These can be mitigated using threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures.

    5. Security misconfiguration
    	

    Many legacy Extensible Markup Language (XML) processors evaluate extremal entities, which can be leveraged to disclose internal files. What’s more, default or ad-hoc configurations can lead to security misconfigurations that lead to vulnerabilities.

    6. Vulnerable and outdated components
    	

    Components often run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerability occurs, all components and applications can be compromised.

    7. Identification and authentication failures
    	

    If authentication mechanisms are not implemented properly, attackers can expose these vulnerabilities

    8. Software and data integrity failures
    	

    These failures can lead to remote code execution which can be used to perform attacks.

    9. Security logging and monitoring failures
    	

    Logging and monitoring that does not integrate with an incident response technology creates insufficient protection processes.

    10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
    	

    Allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location. This can result in unauthorized actions or access to data within an organization, either in the vulnerable application itself or on other back-end systems that the application can communicate with.

    However, taking the OWASP Top 10 into consideration is just the beginning. OWASP describes the Top 10 as a list of the most pervasive risks that organizations should consider. Modern WAF security must go further to address risks outside the scope of the OWASP Top 10, including the following.

    Risk
    	

    Description

    Bots
    	

    Bots are programs that interact with your applications and often mimic human interaction. Good bots may be allowed to interact with an application, and include: search engines, virtual assistants, and content aggregators (for example., price comparison sites). Bad bot activity can include: web scraping, competitive data mining, personal and financial data harvesting, account takeover and transaction fraud.

    Malicious uploads
    	

    Many web applications allow users to upload their own content, which can include a variety of malicious code payloads.

    Unknown vulnerabilities
    	

    Signature-based solutions cannot protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities. A robust WAF solution must be able to defend against threats for which no signatures exist.

    Zero-day attacks
    	

    Zero-day attacks target previously unknown flaws in an application. When a threat actor discovers a zero-day vulnerability, they can use it to exploit systems that do not have additional defensive measures in place, such as a WAF.

    Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
    	

    In a DDoS attack, attackers use a large number of systems, often a botnet of compromised computers, to overwhelm an application so that it cannot respond to legitimate user requests. Using DDoS attacks, attackers can attempt to simply overwhelm the system with traffic or may attempt to exploit a flaw in the application logic to achieve the same result.

    Learn How Web Application Firewalls Protect APIs
    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Identify how web application firewalls (WAFs) deliver application programming interface (API) protection.
        List how WAFs help organizations meet compliance rules.
        Define how advanced WAF capabilities can help your organization protect data from modern threats.
        Describe how to choose a WAF product.

    How WAFs Deliver API Protection

    The days of basic websites serving up simple Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages have passed. Traffic has become more sophisticated. Web applications today deliver mission-critical services using APIs that provide richer, more responsive experiences by letting the client process raw data instead of just rendering simple HTML.

    These API tools also support the mobile applications that users in the community need to access. When the client has access to a large amount of application data, the impact of an attacker exploiting the API's rules when a WAF isn't in place can be significant. These tools require a WAF to ensure they are protected from OWASP Top 10 threats. WAFs can protect against file inclusion vulnerabilities and others seeking to take advantage of internet traffic, a server plugin, or other vulnerabilities.

    Note

    Not all WAFs have API security capabilities. The addition of API capabilities is how WAFs evolve to web application and API protection (WAAP).

    A traditional web application makes a get request to a server, and the browser renders HTML. API-based applications rely on more powerful clients to process raw data.
    WAFs for Compliance

    Making the data that web applications rely on available to the application often comes with compliance obligations. WAFs help organizations meet compliance rules as well. Regardless of your service provider, compliance needs to be your primary priority.

    Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), for example, defines a set of application security standards that organizations handling credit cards must comply with. PCI 6.6 specifically will often come up when discussing web application firewall technologies designed to keep traffic and assets secure. The standard requires inspection of traffic to web applications that interact with card data. To comply with the standard, organizations have two options.

        Web application code reviews (which can slow down deployments)
        Deploying WAFs between the client and the web application.

    In a world where organizations are expected to frequently and rapidly deploy code changes as they adopt software development and IT operations (DevOps) methodologies, a robust WAF will often be a better solution for meeting these types of compliance rules while protecting the organization from OWASP Top 10 threats.
    Advanced Capabilities of Web Application Firewalls

    Let’s take a look at some advanced WAF capabilities, such as machine learning, for delivering both accurate detection and reduced management overhead.

    Machine Learning

    Traditional web application learning techniques require manual tuning and are prone to false positives. Tuning applications every time there is a change and remediating false positives drives up administrative overhead for teams and others in the organization's community that may already be overburdened.

    WAFs can use machine learning to update their protection model automatically as the web application evolves. This means application security teams and others in the IT department spend less time manually tuning the web application firewalls according to traffic and creating exceptions based on false positives.

    Advanced Reporting

    WAFs can provide organizations full visibility into event details. They can generate attack logs that include the critical information that security operations center (SOC) analysts need, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) body information, and clear indications on why security rules require an application request to be blocked.
    Choosing a WAF Product

    In choosing a WAF product, organizations should look for one that includes the following capabilities. 

        Backed by threat intelligence
        OWASP Top 10 protection
        API WAF management
        Bot mitigation
        DDoS protection
        File protection
        Information leak prevention
        Cross site request forgery (CSRF) protection
        Web socket security
        API security

    You should also consider the infrastructure used to deliver the WAF, whether it can be easily integrated with your sandbox and other security solutions, whether it includes a content delivery network (CDN), and whether its attack logs can be easily exported to your external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.

        Describe the goals of cybersecurity compliance analysis.
        Explain the importance of cybersecurity compliance analysis. 

    What Is Cybersecurity Compliance?

    Cybersecurity trailblazers make security intrinsic to their business. There’s a rising and enormous cost associated with data breaches, a trend that’s driving the need for more robust cybersecurity strategies. According to a report by Accenture, in their annual survey among 4,744 global respondents around the current state of cybersecurity resilience, about one-third of all respondents say poor governance and compliance is a problem.

    To help protect businesses and consumers from these breaches, governments, regulators, and organizations put in place laws, regulations, standards, and policies that address issues of cybersecurity and data protection. If your business collects, stores, or uses sensitive information, then failure to comply with these mandates can have a profound impact on your business processes. A data breach can lead to a significant financial loss, market share value loss, as well as costs spent on compensating affected customers. 

    In general, compliance is defined as following rules and meeting requirements. In cybersecurity, compliance means creating and maintaining a program that establishes risk-based controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information stored, processed, or transferred. These controls are used to demonstrate adherence to the applicable compliance requirements in order to establish the necessary level of security.

    Cybersecurity compliance analysis is the process of assessing whether the behavior of an information technology (IT) system or application conforms to the cybersecurity rules and regulations in force. Effective cybersecurity compliance analysis helps you prioritize compliance risks, maps compliance risks to the applicable parts of the organization that must help address them, and effectively allocates resources to mitigate compliance risks. This analysis can be performed either by an internal team or a third party. While a business may have compliance analysts focused on other types of rules and regulations—such as standard accounting principles, medical treatment protocols, or laws against criminal activity—cybersecurity compliance involves rules and regulations specifically pertaining to protecting sensitive data by securing IT systems.

    As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, your work helps to protect sensitive information, including:

        Personally identifiable information (PII), such as first and last name, date of birth, and government-issued personal identification number (PIN).
        Protected health information (PHI), such as medical history, records of admissions, and prescription records.
        Financial data, such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and debit card PINs.
        Authenticators, including biometrics such as fingerprints, voice prints, and facial recognition data.
        Other sensitive data, such as IP addresses, email addresses, usernames, and passwords. 

    Failing to adequately screen your and your suppliers’ security for protections of this data can increase the likelihood of data breaches, which can shut down operations, damage customer trust, and incur hefty regulatory penalties. For these reasons, your analysis of the security compliance of your organization's internal and external systems must be comprehensive, efficient, and scalable.

    The Importance of Cybersecurity Compliance

    Now that we know what cybersecurity compliance is, let’s talk about why it’s important. Cybersecurity compliance helps companies, governments, and other entities process sensitive data securely. It makes sense of existing and new laws, regulations, standards, and policies to help organizations ensure they follow cybersecurity rules or guidelines. 

    Cyberattacks happen all the time, and the number and variety of attacks continues to grow, making efficient cybersecurity difficult for most organizations. With a drastic shortage in trained cybersecurity professionals, today’s environment has become increasingly challenging. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, you play a crucial role in protecting your organization from the next attack.
    Cybersecurity Risk Management vs Compliance

    It’s important to note that, while similar, cybersecurity risk management and cybersecurity compliance are not necessarily the same thing. Compliance requirements often lag behind cybersecurity risk. Simply put, it’s not enough to just be compliant with the bare minimum regulatory requirements. Your organization should also understand its cybersecurity risk posture as a whole, and put in place policies and controls to respond to these risks. In doing so, you have a crucial role to play. You must work with the cybersecurity risk managers in your organization to ensure not only compliance with applicable regulations, policies, and frameworks but also that the organization is doing its best to create a security culture that extends beyond compliance.

    A key part of this is streamlining cybersecurity efforts to be both compliant and secure, without imposing multiple, competing requirements on the business. You do so by cutting across organizational silos, aggregating information, and working with cybersecurity risk managers to provide a 360-degree view of IT risk, compliance, policy management, and vendor security practices. This enables your organization to execute and manage an effective cyber resilience strategy that both addresses compliance concerns and ensures the organization is managing cyber risk holistically without increasing the reporting burden on your teams.

    Cybersecurity compliance touches every business that needs to collect, maintain, analyze, and protect some type of sensitive data. This makes cybersecurity compliance important, no matter what industry you work in. What’s more, organizations that perform internal audits and undergo third-party audits and assessments know it plays a critical role in helping their ongoing battle of managing cyber threats. These audits and assessments provide an independent review of existing and needed controls, and help the organization understand and address the diverse risks of the digital landscape.

    Meeting or exceeding regulatory compliance standards and requirements has benefits for organizations beyond protecting sensitive data as required by law. Implementing the appropriate safeguards and security measures to protect sensitive customer and employee information bolsters your company’s security posture. This, in turn, helps to protect intellectual property such as trade secrets, software code, product specifications, and other information that gives your company a competitive advantage.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Describe a cybersecurity compliance analyst career.
        List key skills relevant to the role of a cybersecurity compliance analyst. 

    A Cybersecurity Compliance Analyst Career

    Let’s explore whether you’d be a good fit for the role of a compliance analyst by starting with some questions.

    Who are you?

    Are you driven to make businesses more secure? Are you passionate about process improvement? Do you thrive on developing innovative insights to solve complex challenges? If you answered yes to these questions, then cybersecurity compliance analysis may be a great fit for you.

    What do you like to do?

    The work of a compliance analyst involves conducting audits and assessments, and assisting with risk management reviews and third-party assessments. In this role, your goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of an organization’s data and systems. You also work with teams across the organization to identify and mitigate cybersecurity compliance risks, and manage reporting on cybersecurity compliance to both internal and external stakeholders. You document the organization's cybersecurity compliance posture in written reports, manage compliance efforts to meet both internal and external deadlines, and help prioritize the most critical compliance gaps to be addressed first.

    What type of organization do you want to work for? 

    You might work for an advisory service firm, helping companies develop reports to demonstrate compliance with various laws, regulations, and standards. You may work in the healthcare industry, helping your organization protect patients’ protected health information (PHI) by assisting with compliance and documentation tasks. Or, you may work for the government, participating in the steps of the authorization process to ensure government systems are secure, and documenting security controls in approved templates and forms. Almost every industry that conducts digital business needs cybersecurity compliance analysts.

    When are you involved in an organization’s work? 

    When in the audit and compliance lifecycle do you get involved? You have a role to play every step of the way—from helping put in place organizational policies that ensure your systems are compliant with applicable laws and regulations, to supporting internal and third-party audits, or inspections, of systems in production to ensure that cybersecurity standards are upheld. You also contribute to security designs during system development and help to maintain a compliant system once it’s been deployed. 

    Being involved throughout the entire lifecycle of a system is key. For example, if you work at a merchant that accepts cardholder data, you may have verified during system development that your payment system satisfies the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) requirements. But if the system is then improperly deployed, or deployed in a hosting environment with other violations, you have not achieved compliance. Maintaining system controls and preventing configuration creep entails putting in place processes and measures that can be tracked and checked in real time to keep from falling out of compliance.

    How are you successful in the role? 

    How do you accomplish all of this? To give you a closer look, let’s meet Earl, a cybersecurity compliance analyst. He works at a government organization that specializes in protecting consumer financial interests by creating and enforcing consumer financial protection laws, including laws about how companies must implement cybersecurity protections to protect customer financial data. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, Earl:

        Provides guidance to help financial companies understand and comply with cybersecurity rules and statutes related to customer financial data. Some of these resources include regulatory guidance, a map of money transmission laws, and guides for financial sector executives, for example.
        Conducts examinations of how companies comply with laws related to securing customer financial data. For example, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s Safeguards Rule, financial institutions must have measures in place to keep customer information such as names, phone numbers, and credit card account numbers secure. Earl may conduct examinations of these financial institutions to verify they have a written cybersecurity plan that describes their program to protect customer information.
        Leads deep dives into systems that accept, store, process and transmit cardholder data at merchants, banks, and credit card processors to evaluate their compliance with regulations to investigate security gaps.
        Evaluates how companies’ policies stack up to regulations by analyzing documentation, roles and responsibilities, and processes to ensure systems meet security requirements.
        Assesses management and technical controls to ensure specific security compliance requirements are met. Some of these requirements include building and maintaining a secure network and systems, protecting cardholder data, and maintaining a vulnerability management program, to name a few.
        Validates the maintenance of secure configurations for systems, such as those that accept, store, process, and transmit cardholder data.
        Shares key examination findings to help organizations limit security risks and comply with laws relating to securing customer financial data.
        Works in a consultative role to help organizations securely navigate an evolving information technology (IT) environment and stay compliant with applicable laws and regulations. 

    Why should you consider this role?

    Why should you consider a cybersecurity compliance analyst career like Earl's? This is a fast-growing field in a crucial industry. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, you work across the business, getting exposure to implementing and managing the various aspects of a security program—including perimeter defense, access control, encryption, and more. You also make a real impact in raising awareness of the potential for a data incident, and contributing to the organization’s compliance reporting. This role also has lots of room to learn and grow. Last but not least, you can earn competitive compensation. Sounds pretty great, right?
    Cybersecurity Compliance Analyst Skills

    Like Earl, you’re excited about helping organizations understand, implement, and comply with cybersecurity laws, regulations, standards, and policies. So, what education and skills do you need to pursue this career?

    Education

    It’s possible to find certain entry-level cybersecurity positions that require applicants to have a course of post-secondary study lasting 2 or 3 years. However, most jobs require a 4-year bachelor's degree in cybersecurity or a related field, such as IT or computer science, a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline, or business administration. 

    Cybersecurity students sit at desks; above them is an image of a computer with a lock in the middle, and behind that is a globe with 1s and 0s.

    Experience

    Typically, employers look for candidates with anywhere from 2 to 8 years of experience analyzing the development of cybersecurity policies and strategies. Experience with risk analysis is also valuable. Cybersecurity compliance analysts also need experience briefing clients and team members on technical, policy, and functional issues. 

    Certifications

    To help you skill up and get your foot in the door, pursuing a certification is a great idea. Here are some common certifications for cybersecurity compliance analysts (note that some certifications require a certain number of years of experience before they can be obtained).

        The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) A+ (Plus) Certification
        The International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)² Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP). Note that this certificate requires 5 years of experience to complete. If you do not have the requisite experience, you can become an Associate of (ISC)² in the meantime while you gain the required work experience.
        The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA). Note that this certificate requires 5 years of experience, but there are some ways to bring that down based on other related work experience and education.
        The Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) Security Essentials (GSEC) Certification
        ISACA Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) Certification 

    Knowledge

    As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, having a solid understanding of the basics—such as security frameworks, regulations, and standards—is key. You should have strong familiarity with security governance, compliance, and risk management frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) Cybersecurity Framework, ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information Related Technology (COBIT) framework, and PCI DSS, to name a few. It’s also helpful to have knowledge of control assessment techniques, which include questionnaires, on-site visits, and penetration tests. Additional areas of expertise that are helpful, but not required, include data protection, access control, network and endpoint security, incident response and handling, vulnerability management, and firewalls. 

    Business Skills

    In addition to these technical skills, it’s also critical to hone your business skills. A huge part of being successful as a cybersecurity compliance analyst is effectively communicating and documenting requirements and findings, analyzing security gaps, and thinking strategically. You should know how to consult with various stakeholders in an organization, as well as demonstrate exemplary leadership and organizational skills. You should enjoy working as part of a team, researching answers to questions and problems, and paying close attention to detail. 

    Skills-first

    While traditional qualifications like education and certifications are important, cybersecurity is increasingly shifting toward a skills-first approach. This means employers are prioritizing demonstrated evidence of skills and abilities over formal credentials alone. To prepare for this changing landscape engage in team and independent projects that build proficiency in key skills. Document these projects in a portfolio of work (e.g., github, personal website) as tangible proof of your proficiency to send along with a resume and to showcase during interviews. Finally, during interviews, be prepared to demonstrate to employers that you possess the required skills they seek.

    Learning Objectives

    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

        Explain the key features and tools in Grantmaking.
        Define some objects used to track information with Grantmaking.
        Describe examples of how to use Grantmaking at public sector and nonprofit organizations. 

    Note

    Salesforce offers both integrated platform solutions and managed packages. This module covers Grantmaking, an integrated solution in Salesforce.

    For more information about Grants Management, a managed package product that’s different from Grantmaking, complete the Grants Management Basics module.

    If you’re unsure which solution your organization uses, check with your Salesforce administrator.
    Goal: Grantmaking Greatness

    If you work for a grantmaking organization, or a nonprofit that delivers funding, you’re in the business of progress. Sure, the way you achieve those outcomes is by processing applications and granting money to people and organizations working toward your shared goals—but you’re looking for results.

    You need a solution that delivers, manages, and tracks funding programs to create stronger outcomes. A system that minimizes your time spent on process and compliance is key to success.

    Meet Grantmaking, a Salesforce solution for foundations, nonprofits, government agencies, and other public sector organizations that provide funding for a specific purpose. It’s an end-to-end grantmaking solution that drives efficiency, creates positive experiences for grantees, and invests in better outcomes.

    Grantmaking helps you manage the entire grantmaking process. It extends your Salesforce instance to give you a unified view of your funding programs throughout the planning, delivery, and evaluation stages. 

    Plus, a site template for Experience Cloud helps you create an online portal to communicate and collaborate with your grantees. Here’s an example home page based on the site template.

    The home page of a website for Mountain Rise Foundation.

    The home page presents the imaginary foundation's mission statement with options to access funding opportunities, the application process, awards, and more.

    In this Quick Look module, you gain an overview of Grantmaking and its features.
    The Salesforce Framework for Managing Grants

    Grantmaking adds to Salesforce’s relationship management tools with features designed to manage funding opportunities, set grant budgets, review grant applications, award grants, and manage disbursements on an ongoing basis.

    Let’s explore some objects that help you do that.

    Start by creating your funding programs in Salesforce using the Program object.

    Use the Budget object to define program spending. Budgets enable you to set and track grantmaking budgets for each of your programs, projects, or departments. For example, create budgets for the amount of money available to a program each year. Applicants can also submit project budgets when they apply, based on templates you configure.

    You manage available grant opportunities using the Funding Opportunity object. Funding opportunities can include descriptions of available grants, application instructions, and application start and end dates. You can display these opportunities through your Experience Cloud site, too.

    Funding opportunities can be related to application forms you create using the Action Plan Template, Individual Application Task, and Application Stage Definition objects, along with Omniscript, Flexcard, and Flow Builder.

    After an application is entered, you track it from start to finish with the Individual Application object.

    After an application is in the system, capture feedback from your team using the Application Review object. Standardize how your team works using built-in Salesforce automation tools and other features like action plans, document checklists, and approval processes.

    Then, manage your decisions using the Application Decision and Funding Award objects. Plus, track money sent to grantees using the Funding Disbursement object. Manage additional steps a grantee must take—like interim or annual reports—using the Funding Award Requirement object.

    Then track spending against the budget to neatly close the cycle.
    Grantmaking in Action

    By now you can imagine how Grantmaking fits into your organization’s grantmaking lifecycle. It helps to explore some examples, though.

    Let’s start by visiting the city of Cosville. Its small business administration focuses on boosting the municipality’s economy. However, it spends too much time on cumbersome administrative processes like collecting feedback and entering budget data. 

    With Grantmaking and an Experience Cloud site, Cosville can track reviews in one place to speed up decision making and automate manual tasks. Then it can work with grantees to file their budget numbers directly into Salesforce through an Experience Cloud portal. The result: More time spent on outcomes, less on data entry and chasing down reviewers.

    Now imagine the Mountain Rise Foundation (MRF), a private foundation. It has a small-but-mighty team that wants to build better relationships with grantees. By using Grantmaking and an Experience Cloud site, the foundation streamlines communications with applicants and grantees at every step of the grantmaking lifecycle. Grantmaking has transformed the grantee experience and optimized program outcomes.

    Can you think of how Grantmaking could fit into your organization?

            Track Prospects with Salesforce Leads
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
                Describe the benefits of using leads.
                Create leads.
                Manage lead records.
                Convert leads to opportunities.
            The Leads Advantage

            Every company is unique, but all companies want to find, sell to, and keep customers. Salesforce provides the tools you need to grow your pipeline and make more sales. A lead is one such tool. Leads help you track the people and companies that you define as prospective customers. 

            With leads, you can better track, report on, and target marketing campaigns to prospects. Store your prospects as leads, and then once a lead becomes qualified, you can convert it to an account, contact, and, optionally, an opportunity.

            Leads are especially useful if your company has two separate teams—one that handles lead generation and mass marketing and one that handles sales. The lead generation team can concentrate their work on the Leads tab, and the opportunity team can use the Account, Contact, and Opportunity tabs. 

            Ready to take advantage of the leads tool? Let’s walk through the steps for creating, managing, and converting leads into opportunities.
            Create a Lead

            The first step in selling is to find customers. Here’s how to create a lead to help you do just that.
                Click the Lead tab.
                Click New.
                Create a lead record for your potential customer by entering the lead's name, company, contact information, associated status, and other relevant information.
                Note: Wondering how to determine lead assignments? Some companies assign leads automatically, such as by assigning leads to owners based on the lead’s geographical location. Other companies initially assign all new leads to a queue. Your Salesforce administrator will set up a lead assignment process that works for your company.
                New Lead record

                Click Save.

            You can also add leads by importing a file into Salesforce or through an automatic process, such as a Web-to-Lead form that collects leads from your business website.
            Manage Lead Records

            As you work to qualify your leads—or turn them into opportunities—the lead’s record serves as your workspace. Use the workspace to track interactions with leads, check campaign history, and plan future activities.
                The lead’s status is an important indicator that helps you track where each lead is in your sales process. The traditional way to update a lead’s status is to click Edit while viewing the lead’s record, change the Lead Status, and click Save. If the lead is involved in any marketing campaigns, they are listed in the Campaign History for the lead.
                Review the lead’s Details tab to find and update information about the lead.
                Use the lead’s Activity tab to log your calls and emails to help you remember what you talked about and how the lead responded. Plan for the future by creating Tasks or Events.
                Connect with your coworkers to ask questions, seek advice, or provide information on the lead’s Chatter tab. The Chatter feed for the record also shows when you create activities.
            Convert Leads to Opportunities

            Qualifying a lead indicates that you believe the lead has a use for and interest in your products, and that a sale is a definite possibility. The exact criteria for qualifying and converting leads is part of your company’s unique business process.

            When you qualify a lead, you can convert the lead record into an opportunity. You then work your opportunity until you close the deal.

            Here’s how you convert your lead record into an opportunity.
                On the Leads tab, open your lead record.
                Click Convert.
                In the Account section, create an account from the Company name entered for the lead. If you’re converting a lead who works for an existing account, select the existing account instead.
                In the Contact section, create a contact from the name entered for the lead. If the contact exists, select the existing contact instead.
                In the Opportunity section, enter a descriptive name for the new opportunity so it’s easy to identify the potential deal.
                Check that the Record Owner and Converted Status are correct.
                Click Convert.

            Look at that! You’ve created a lead and qualified it as an opportunity. You’re on your way to closing more deals.

            # 1. Download the Publish Profile for your Azure Web App. You can download this file from the Overview page of your Web App in the Azure Portal.
            # For more information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel#generate-deployment-credentials
            #
            # 2. Create a secret in your repository named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE, paste the publish profile contents as the value of the secret.
            # For instructions on obtaining the publish profile see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions#configure-the-github-secret
            #
            # 3. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME. Optionally, change the AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and NODE_VERSION environment variables below.

                An official transcript is a full record of your academic activities at the University. It is produced by the Student Records Office only and contains the stamp and the signature of an authorised University official to ensure authenticity of the document. The official transcript is confidential and only issued upon request and authorization of the student using the instructions below:

                    Transcripts requested for delivery to World Education Services must include a clear scanned copy of your hard copy degree certificate/s and WES form/s so that we can adhere to WES requirements. We are able to submit your documents electronically. 
                    The Records Office does not offer a secure file transfer delivery method, your transcript can be emailed directly to an institution. Please include the institution’s email address and necessary reference number if available. 
                    Records are not issued to currently registered students until examination results are finalised by the FEC/SEC. 
                    Transcripts will not be issued to students or alumni who owe outstanding fees for past or current studies or those with open disciplinary cases against them. Please send our office an email for more information.

            H I G H

            Follow these recommendations to build your Agility capabilities.

            Install and configure Tableau Server

            Understanding how your hardware, network, databases, and applications interoperate is the first step in planning your Tableau

            Server installation. Documenting this will give you insight for installation and configuration and ongoing platform operations.

            1. Review the Tableau Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Complete the Enterprise Architecture Survey in the Tableau Blueprint Planner.

            3. Leverage these insights to install and configure Tableau Server. For step-by-step guidance, visit the Tableau Help

            documentation for the Tableau Server products you're implementing.

            4. Explore Server Rapid Start to optimize your server installation. Work with our experts to ensure a successful and stable

            Tableau Server environment with a plan for monitoring the scalable growth of users, content, and interactivity.

            Configure user authentication and authorization for Tableau Server

            To deploy Tableau, you will need to define authentication and authorization protocols for users in your organization.

            1. Review the Authentication and Authorization section of Tableau Blueprint. For more detailed guidance and

            configuration instructions, review the Tableau Server Help documentation on Authentication (Windows | Linux).

            2. Configure either a local identity store or an external identity store at time of install.

            3. Choose a Tableau Server authentication method that is compatible with your identity store.

            Manage Tableau licenses

            Licenses should be managed according to your organization's software license processes for allocating to new Tableau users,

            changing Tableau license levels as analytical skills increase, and reclaiming available Tableau licenses when someone leaves

            the company.

            1. Review the Tableau License Management section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Define a process for allocating licenses to new Tableau users.

            3. Define a process for changing Tableau license levels for current Tableau users.

            4. Define a process for reclaiming Tableau licenses when someone leaves the company.

            5. Enable license management features in your Tableau environment - Login-Based License Management and Grant

            Role on Sign In - and update processes accordingly.

            6. Document this information, and it to your Enablement Intranet.

            Deploy client software (Desktop/Prep Builder)

            Distributing Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder (for Creators) can be done in a few different ways. Determine and

            document the process.

            1. Review the Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Determine if you want to customize the install (e.g., no prompts, inclusion of drivers, etc.) and configure your process

            accordingly.

            3. If virtual desktop support is required, determine how you want to manage license deactivation.

            4. Configure Tableau Desktop license usage reporting to gather usage information for individual instances of Tableau

            Desktop.

            5. Document this information, and it to your Enablement Intranet.

            Configure back-up and restore

            A Tableau Server administrator should perform daily backups of Tableau Server and its data. Taking these steps can help

            ensure that Tableau Server runs with minimum loss.

            1. Review the Back-up and Restore section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Learn how to use the Tableau Services Manager (TSM) command line tool to back-up and restore Tableau data,

            including Tableau Server's own PostgreSQL database, which stores workbook and user metadata, data extract files,

            server configuration data, and log files.

            3. Define a cadence for performing back ups using the TSM command line tool.

            4. Perform back-ups in accordance with your planned cadence.

            Monitor Tableau Server process status

            In order to ensure continued performance, your administrator should have a process in place for monitoring the Tableau

            Server process status and a documented plan of action for when the process is "down" or "status unavailable".

            1. Review the Tableau Server Process Status section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Determine how you will monitor, at minimum, process state changes, especially "Down" and "Status unavailable".

            3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond if a process is not running as expected (e.g., who will support the

            issue, where will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

            4. If you've purchased Tableau Advanced Management, explore the Resource Monitoring Tool to gain a comprehensive

            look at the health of Tableau Server, including process status. Contact your Account Team if you're interested in

            Tableau Advanced Management.

            Monitor Backgrounder jobs

            The Backgrounder process runs server jobs, including extract refreshes, subscriptions, flow runs, and data-driven alerts.

            Administrators and users will want to know when these processes fail so corrective action can be taken.

            1. Review the Built-in Alerts section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on leveraging built-in alerts to monitor for

            background job failures.

            2. Provide enablement to Administrators, and the Creator user base more broadly, on how built-in alerts can be leveraged

            for process failures, such as extract refresh failures, flow run failures, etc.

            3. Provide enablement to Administrators, and the Creator user base more broadly, on how they can reinitiate the process

            manually using, in most cases, "Run Now".

            4. Administrators may also want to develop similar processes using the REST API or tabcmd commands as a fail safe in

            case process owners are out of the office.

            5. Document guidance on how users can review Backgrounder jobs, and post this information to your Enablement

            Intranet.

            Configure built-in alerts

            Alerts provide critical information about platform outages so you can take immediate action to triage the issue, communicate

            with users, etc.

            1. Review the Built-in Alerts section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Configure notifications about system alerts and failures (e.g., process status, drive space constraints, etc.) during

            installation.

            3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond when an alert is triggered (e.g., who will support the issue, where

            will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

            Review performance thresholds

            Administrative views are dashboards that are included with Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud and help you understand system

            utilization and how users are interacting with content so that you can proactively monitor system activity and other scheduled

            tasks.

            1. Review the Administrative Views for Monitoring section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on monitoring performance

            thresholds.

            2. Leverage default or custom administrative views (or utilize the Dashboard Load Times Accelerator on our Tableau

            exchange) to understand how Tableau is performing throughout the day, including background tasks to ensure they are

            executing on time. These views should be leveraged to inform real-time action as well as trend analysis.

            3. Define a process on how Administrators will respond when real-time action is needed (e.g., who will support the issue,

            where will you work the issue, how will inform affected users and keep them up to date, etc.).

            4. Enable your teams by driving best-practice awareness into existing analytics community engagements, such as user

            group meetings, analytics academies, and competitions.

            5. Enact Performance Thresholds that work for your organization. Read more about this process with our blog, How to

            Improve Dashboard Load Times with People and Processes.

            Monitor license utilization

            Monitoring licenses can help you administrators monitor usage and answer questions like who is using licenses, which types of

            licenses they're using and if you need more or fewer licenses.

            1. Review the Administrative Views for Monitoring section of Tableau Blueprint for guidance on monitoring license

            utilization.

            2. Define a monthly cadence for reviewing license utilization details, including usage, availability, and upcoming

            expirations.

            3. Review license utilization in accordance with your planned cadence.

            Define an upgrade process, including end-user communications plans

            Defining the when and how on upgrades across all products in the Tableau platform includes decision points around upgrade

            frequency, version selection, and version compatibility. When these areas are addressed early, administrators can better

            manage users' expectations, rather than having to react to business demands for new features and functionality.

            1. Review the Upgrades section Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Define a cadence for performing platform upgrades, including Tableau Server, Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, and

            Tableau Bridge.

            3. Develop an enablement plan to prepare users for platform upgrades.

            4. Develop a communications plan to inform users about platform upgrades, leveraging all channels available in your

            organization.

            5. Perform upgrades in accordance with your planned cadence.

            6. Explore Server Upgrade where Tableau experts do the heavy lifting so you can quickly and successful upgrade your

            environment and your team can produce deeper and more relevant findings by taking advantage of Tableau's newest

            features.

            Complete load test and capacity planning

            Load testing helps you understand your Tableau Server’s capacity with respect to your unique environment, data, workload,

            and usage profile. Capacity planning, by contrast, helps you ensure optimal Tableau Server performance and sufficient

            capacity to handle increased workloads.

            1. Review the Load Testing section and Capacity Planning section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Define a cadence for performing load testing. In general, this should be conducted two to four times a year in

            conjunction with upgrades and server scale-up or scale-out expansions.

            3. Define a cadence for performing capacity planning. Depending on the size of your organization, user demand, and

            historical growth rates, you may need to do this at 6-month, quarterly, or monthly intervals.

            4. Perform load testing and capacity planning in accordance with your planned cadence.

            Perform database maintenance

            Data maintenance creates free space on the Tableau Server deployments by deleting old files, including log files, temp files,

            and rows from the http_request table.

            1. Review the Database Maintenance section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Define a cadence for performing database maintenance.

            3. Perform database maintenance in accordance with your planned cadence.

            Deploy Tableau Mobile

            Mobile business intelligence enables any user to make decisions no matter where they are. As a result, you should provide

            users with the ability to access Tableau from anywhere.

            1. Review the Tableau Mobile Deployment section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Gather organizational requirements for enterprise apps to better understand how you can control app delivery,

            customize the sign-in experience, configure app policies, and provide additional security and governance controls.

            3. Document guidance on how users can leverage Tableau Mobile, and post this information to your Enablement Intranet.

            Install add-ons and extensions on Tableau Server

            Tableau supports a robust extensibility framework for deep and complex enterprise integrations and embedded analytics

            solutions. Define a process for how you will leverage these capabilities in your environment.

            1. Review the Extensibility section of Tableau Blueprint.

            2. Determine the extent to which you want to install add-ons and extensions to be deployed in the environment.

            3. Document guidance on how users can request the installation of add-ons and extensions, and post this information to

            your Enablement Intranet.

            Get to Know Application Security
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe what an application is.
                Define application security and its role in relation to application development.

            What Is an Application?

            If you’ve ever used a computer, you’ve used an application. To define it, an application is a computer software package that performs one or more tasks and enables direct user interaction. But let’s break down what that really means by looking at examples of applications and how we use them.

            Applications come in many forms such as database programs, web browsers, email clients, spreadsheets, media players, word processors, and image/photo editing software to name a few. Each of these software packages allows a user to interact directly with the application. For example, when you use word processing software, you interact directly with the application when you type, delete, or copy and paste text. And, you interact with applications in different ways—whether it’s on a computer using a photo editing software package like Photoshop, interacting with a mobile app on your smartphone, or conducting business transactions on a web-based banking application. That’s pretty straightforward, right? 

            There are two ways developers create applications. They develop proprietary code that is not shared outside of an organization, or they develop code through open source projects, which are designed and developed in a public, collaborative manner with developers working together. 

            Open source applications grant developers the right to use, study, and change the software, thus allowing it to be adapted and applied to a variety of use cases. There is an entire community dedicated to developing open source projects. As someone who may be interested in becoming an application security engineer, contributing to open source projects is a great way to get practical experience in application development and security while sharpening and proving your skills. As a result, you will better understand how applications are developed and function, and start to understand the role of application security in the coding and software development lifecycle.
            The Role of Application Security

            In an organization’s technology stack, the application layer is the closest layer to the user. It allows interaction with the user and therefore provides the largest attack surface for intruders. Because of this, a relatively large number of security breaches are the result of application vulnerabilities. 

            Applications can also provide a treasure trove of personal data an attacker would love to steal, tamper with, or destroy, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, national identification data (such as Social Security numbers), and email addresses. This means protecting applications is a key part of cybersecurity, in order to minimize the risks of data loss and the resulting negative financial, reputational, privacy, or legal impacts for an organization and its customers. 

            Application security engineers need to think like an attacker to understand how an application could possibly be misused, while also ensuring that input provided by legitimate users is sanitized, validated, and processed safely by the application. 

            Application security engineers focus on protecting applications in order to prevent attackers from gaining access to sensitive data. Since it is much easier and less expensive to find security flaws in the early stages of software development, application security engineers should gather security requirements before any design or development work begins.

            An engineer is looking through a magnifying glass at a bug on a laptopApplication security engineers work with development teams and business units to help design, create, document, code, test, deploy, and maintain secure applications. The process of designing and building applications is known as the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Application developers are responsible for the documentation and programming (coding) steps in this process. They write the source code that causes an application to carry out its desired tasks. Application security engineers partner with application developers and others throughout the SDLC to protect applications by diagnosing, documenting, and remediating application security vulnerabilities.

            Typically in an organization, an application developer's main objective is to produce working code as quickly as possible to meet business requirements. As a result, writing secure code is sometimes an afterthought. This is where application security engineers can be super helpful by building security into the development process so that sensitive data remains protected. In doing so, they aim to ensure that an application provides what is commonly referred to as CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. 

            For example, application security engineers help developers design and deploy the application in a way that requires proper authentication (to protect the confidentiality of data), transfers sensitive information securely to prevent it from being modified (integrity), and ensures that users can access their data (availability). 

            Application security engineers are often embedded within an application development team and serve as advisers to designers and developers. They ensure that application requirements include security considerations, they suggest secure authentication protocols during the design phase, they implement code reviews to check for common security vulnerabilities, they test applications before deployment, and they advise on the timing and methods for patching vulnerabilities.

            In this unit, you learned what an application is and how application development and security functions work together in practice. In the next unit, you learn about the business impact of application security, the skills application security engineers need, and common application security scenarios.

            Learn Application Security Engineer Skills
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain the impact of application security on business.
                List the key skills needed to become an application security professional.
                Describe common application security scenarios.

            The Impact of Application Security on Businesses

            Inadequate application security can have huge negative consequences for an organization. Cyber intruders attack a variety of organizations every day in the hope of enriching themselves by extracting money, corporate information, and intellectual property. Attackers use the hijacked data to make unauthorized purchases and steal consumers’ identities. 

            If you follow the news, you know that attackers have successfully compromised applications to access data stored in the computer systems of retailers, credit reporting companies, airlines, entertainment companies, government offices, schools, and many other organizations. In one case, a hotel chain was breached by a foreign country. In another case, a SQL injection attack, which we’ll cover later, installed spyware on a company’s computers which exposed customer credit card information. In multiple cases, intruders stole credit card data by taking advantage of weak data encryption systems. In total, these attacks exposed the personal information of hundreds of millions of customers.

            These security breaches resulted in direct economic impacts from fraud and theft, but a security breach can also yield indirect economic impacts, like the loss of reputation. This can produce additional financial consequences on the business due to a loss of customers, reduced shareholder trust, and damaged brand image. Security breaches can also have legal and regulatory ramifications that result in fines and sanctions. 

            Application security engineers have a critical role to play in ensuring that customer data is adequately protected by business applications. Because the role of an application security engineer is so important, they need to have a wide range of proficiencies. Let’s dig into this a bit more to see what skills an application security engineer needs.
            Application Security Engineer Skills

            Imagine that you’re going to fly to a distant island for a tropical vacation. Before you board your airplane, you must pass through multiple airport security checkpoints. Security personnel check your ID and boarding pass, you walk through a metal detector, your luggage is X-Rayed, you pass airport security dogs, and security guards monitor TV screens to watch for unusual activity. These are layers of security at the airport to ensure that you enjoy a safe trip to your destination. Similar to the security personnel at an airport, an application security engineer must be aware of attacker entry points and provide the necessary safeguards against vulnerabilities at each phase of the application’s development and deployment.

            Airport security personnel check travelers and luggage

            Reports from security associations (ISC)² and Information Systems Security Association International (ISSA) discuss the cyber security skills shortage that has been growing for years. An increase in security incidents has led organizations to report an acute need for application security professionals to protect applications and data. In light of this and the fact that application security engineers require more training, an application security engineer can often earn more money than application developers.

            Application security engineers employ various techniques at different stages of an application’s software development lifecycle (SDLC) to uncover security vulnerabilities. In order to do this, an application security engineer must have a good grasp of many technical skills, which include:

                Threat modeling: Think about how attackers can compromise a system and what protections are needed against them
                Secure Software Development Life Cycle (SSDLC): Help developers write secure code that minimizes vulnerabilities by implementing secure coding standards, techniques, and best practices
                Security code reviews: Identify security vulnerabilities in source code before an application is deployed to production
                Vulnerability testing and analysis: Discover weaknesses once an application is deployed and advise development teams on remediation

            Since application security engineers work with various people (application developers, testers, designers, and others), they need to be good collaborators and communicators. They also need to be good writers since they generate documents that explain their technical findings. In some cases, they need to use their persuasive powers to convince management why a certain security feature should be installed before an application is deployed. Often, they must use their critical thinking skills to determine the various ways that an intruder would try to attack an application. Then they need to find creative solutions to thwart potential attacks. If an intrusion occurs, they investigate the incident to help identify the source of the compromise and harden the application against future attacks.

            On top of the skills listed above, the following certifications can bolster an application security engineer’s knowledge.

                GIAC Web Application Defender (GWEB)
                Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP)
                Secure Software Practitioner (SSP)
                Certified Application Security Engineer (CASE)
                Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation 

            If you’re considering a career as an application security professional, earning a college degree in computer science is a good way to start on that path. Application security engineers will often start out as application developers and then transition into the cybersecurity field. Also, multiple colleges offer degrees in cybersecurity. It’s definitely an exciting field with many opportunities.

            Now that you know about the skills you need to be an application security engineer, let's look at what common security scenarios an application security engineer encounters and how to protect applications in these situations.
            Common Application Security Scenarios

            Cybercriminals look for the easiest access to steal, modify, or destroy data that requires the least amount of effort and provides the biggest payback. The more complex an application is, the higher the probability that it contains security vulnerabilities. Applications, especially web applications, are targets of cybercriminals because they present a large and relatively easily exploitable attack surface (the user interface) that can allow an intruder to access sensitive information stored on a computer. Also, intruders do not need any special tools to attack a web application. All they need is a computer and an Internet connection.

            While attackers are trying to figure out how to infiltrate an application, application security engineers are focused on minimizing vulnerabilities in application code and ensuring application components are securely configured in order to prevent unauthorized access to customer accounts and data. A valuable resource to consult when reviewing applications security risks is the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). OWASP is an international organization that provides freely available information focused on improving software security.

            So, what are some common risks an application security engineer may encounter? An injection attack is a good example and occurs when there is improper sanitization of application inputs. In an injection attack, an intruder inserts code, instead of expected input data, into the applications input handling logic (the code that manages communication between an end user interface and a database). 

            If the application is written incorrectly, the application will run the code that the attacker injects. For example, structured query language, known commonly as SQL, could be entered into an email address field on a web page. SQL is a language used in programming and is designed to manage data. If there is no check on the input field, an attacker might be able to extract information (like health records) from the application’s database by using the SQL code. 

            To sanitize a user’s input, an application should ensure that the application handles user input as data instead of commands and includes only allowlisted characters (an allowlist is a list of characters that are granted access to a system). When an allowlist is used, all other entities are denied access, except those included in the allowlist, and those that don’t exceed the maximum data field lengths.

            Other responsibilities of application security engineers are reviewing, testing, and verifying code during the development process to ensure user inputs are properly sanitized in order to help prevent against the injection attack described above. This is especially critical in the context of agile software development, which seeks to deliver application functionality faster than other development methods. But the agile method adds complexity because it requires continuous updating of applications to keep up with end-user expectations. Developers are expected to provide new features and fix discovered bugs at a rapid pace. Applications must be hardened to prevent exploits, and it's the application security engineer’s job to advise the development team on the most efficient way of doing so.

            Weak, or nonexistent, encryption is another prevalent application security shortcoming that can allow attackers to expose sensitive data. Applications are vulnerable when they use protocols like HTTP that transmit data as clear text. Instead, applications should use secure protocols like HTTPS that encrypt data transmissions, so the data can’t be read without the proper decryption key. Old, weak encryption algorithms and internally developed encryption functions should be avoided. Instead, application security engineers should rely on secure, standards-based encryption algorithms.

            Application security engineers help developers follow a Secure SDLC process. They adopt secure application design and architecture techniques based on well-known security practices, which include providing strong authentication and authorization and employing secure session management to prevent unauthorized access. 

            Application security engineers deploy applications that prevent users from logging in with default credentials, since this is a common attack vector. They sanitize user input to hinder injection attacks. Some data breaches have succeeded due to weak encryption, so application security engineers use strong algorithms with appropriate encryption key management to encrypt data transmissions and stored data (data at rest). Then if attackers infiltrate the system, they can’t extract any useful information since they won’t know how to decrypt the data. 

            Application security engineers ensure that errors are handled properly so that no sensitive information is released to the user. They also perform static and dynamic application security testing during and after application development and monitor the application for any unusual activity after deployment.
            Sum It Up

            In this unit, we covered how an application security breach can impact a business, what skills application security engineers need, and explored common application security scenarios. Next, let’s discuss the first step every good application security engineer takes: identifying the applications in their environment, and their associated risks.

            Understand Network Security
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe what a network is.
                Identify ways people and assets access a network.
                Explain network security engineering.

            What Is a Network?

            A network is a fabric of interconnected elements that are related to each other. We encounter a variety of networks on a daily basis. Networks allow us to travel, to connect with other people, to view entertainment content, to collect and disburse information, and so much more. Similarly, a computer network connects two or more computers with various devices in order to share resources among people and other computers. Computer networks consist of many devices: servers, routers, computers, printers, scanners, and so on. We access computer networks to check social media, read email, review our bank account balance, and perform countless other functions.

            In this module, we get to know Jim and Florence who are network security professionals. We learn about their job responsibilities, plus the skills they need and the tools they use to protect computer networks from potential security threats.

            A phone, tablet, laptop, and desktop are connected to a Wi-Fi network.
            How People and Devices Access a Network

            Because we live in an interconnected world, it’s important to understand how computer network access works. It’s also imperative that we protect these networks since we rely on them every day. Let’s look at how encryption and authentication help to protect networks.

            Some computer networks are public and some are private. A public computer network allows anybody to connect to it. You access a public computer network whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot at a coffee shop or inside an airport. A private computer network has restricted access. It allows only certain people and devices to connect to it. In this way, a private network regulates who and what can access its resources. Businesses operate private networks that allow their employees to communicate with each other and access internal, company-related information.

            Since we don’t want just anybody to access our personal information, like our bank account balance, websites use authentication and encryption to protect network access and data transfers. To check your account balance, your bank requires that you prove who you are—this is authentication.

            Encryption converts data from standard text into coded data that is not humanly readable. This ensures that nobody else can retrieve your private data that is being transmitted across a public computer network. Websites use encryption to protect the information that’s passed between your device, for example, your cell phone and your bank. Many websites use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to encrypt data. 

            Now let’s check in with Florence. She’s a network security engineer at a large bank that serves customers in multiple countries. Part of Florence’s job is to ensure that only an authorized account holder can access his or her account. Her bank adopted an authentication process that requires the account holder to provide a username and password, or a debit card and a PIN (personal identification number), to log in to their account.

            Florence also implemented multi-factor authentication, known as MFA. To access their account with MFA, a customer provides their username/password and is then required to verify their identity with an additional authentication factor, such as an authenticator app or security key. MFA provides an added layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access to bank accounts.
            Understand Network Security

            We expect computer networks to be available and secure 24 hours a day so we can access them whenever and wherever we want. When computer networks are unavailable, it affects how we conduct our daily lives. If your bank’s computer system is unavailable, you may be unable to pay your bills (ouch!) or transfer funds to the appropriate account.

            Because of the massive amount of personal, health, financial, and other data stored on computer networks, securing public and private computer networks is essential. As a result, network security professionals build multiple layers of security into their computer systems to provide what is commonly referred to as CIA: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

            Many types of people may try to gain unauthorized access to a computer network. These range from hackers who want to gain access for fun or fame, to cybercriminals who want to steal money and information, to cyberterrorists who want to disrupt and damage.

            As a network security engineer at a medical clinic, Jim knows health records are a prime target for cybercriminals. Any security breach can have legal and regulatory ramifications resulting in fines and sanctions. To minimize those risks, Jim uses hardware and software tools that provide added layers of protection for patients.

            While Jim is aware that external cybercriminals want to attack his systems, he knows that threats can also arise internally from intentional and unintentional actions by employees or other authorized users. This can arise from a malicious insider (like a disgruntled employee) or accidental deletion by an uninformed user. Because of this, it’s critical that he knows his system configuration and typical usage patterns so he can recognize potential security threats. In many cases, internal attacks are often accidental occurrences, so the best way to deal with them is through cybersecurity education and awareness for all employees.

            Stadium ticket takers check tickets as sports fans wait in line.

            In the end, it’s the network security professional’s job to ensure a computer system’s CIA by keeping out unwanted intruders while providing authorized access to those who need it. Network security professionals are not always the most popular people in an organization because the security measures that they employ can make network access a bit of a challenge. Think of their job as being similar to a stadium ticket taker. This person causes a slowdown in the stadium entry process that can result in ticket holders having to wait in line. But the ticket takers fill an important role by ensuring that each person who enters the stadium has a valid ticket.

            Describe the Healthcare Technology Landscape
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe the healthcare technology landscape.
                Identify the main goals of healthcare industry organizations.
                Define key healthcare technologies.
                Define key cybersecurity terms used in the healthcare industry. 

            What Is Healthcare Technology?

            Most people use healthcare technology (healthtech) every day even if they don’t know it. From wearable devices such as smartwatches that track heart rate to the Internet of Things (IoT) to track insulin levels in diabetes patients, healthtech’s use is widespread and continues to grow at a rapid pace. But what is healthtech and why is it important?

            Healthtech is the use of technologies developed for the purpose of improving all aspects of healthcare. These technologies include digital devices, software, and tools designed to support healthcare organizations, doctors, and patients, with the goal of enabling people to access, exchange, and manage healthcare information electronically. 

            A woman holds a mobile phone with a first aid kit symbol, and is surrounded by circles depicting a smartwatch with a blood pressure measurement.

            Healthtech improves patients’ quality of care by increasing the productivity and efficiency of hospitals and other healthcare organizations. By turning over recurring and monotonous tasks to powerful computers, the technology lessens the burden on healthcare professionals and allows them to focus their goals on improving healthcare for all.
            Goals of Healthcare Organizations

            When it comes to quality healthcare, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. In fact, personalization and customization are key as no two people are alike. Tailoring everything from medication to exercise regimens amplifies human health. Healthtech is such a transformative practice that its impacts are causing a lasting change across the globe.

            In general, healthtech aims to:

                Improve the patient experience.
                Improve people’s health.
                Reduce the per-person cost of healthcare. 

            Healthtech supports these aims by expanding options for medical treatments while transforming how medical professionals execute their jobs. It also provides patients with tools for managing their health independently and together with their healthcare practitioners.

            As an enabler of the medical profession principle, “First, do no harm,” healthtech introduces new technologies that, when properly secured, increase patient health by reducing medication errors and improving compliance. For example, pharmacists can use healthtech to improve patient safety by identifying prescription drug conflicts through data correlation of a patient’s allergies with prescribed medications. Healthcare practitioners can use healthtech to access and update patient health records and exchange patient care data with colleagues rapidly for collaboration efforts, secondary opinions, and evaluations.
            Key Healthcare Technologies

            Healthtech is already becoming integrated into every fabric of the healthcare industry from administrative processes to cancer research and drug development. Healthcare practitioners can leverage these technologies to make the patient experience as painless as possible while improving overall human health. Let’s take a closer look at some healthtech applications in the areas of administrative processes, drug development, surgery, IoT, and telehealth.

            Administrative Technologies

            Administrative technologies allow hospitals and healthcare organizations to manage their growing administrative workloads and tasks such as scheduling and documenting patient care. Let’s look at a few of these technologies.

                Artificial intelligence (AI) streamlines patient workflows by calculating wait times and predicting peak busy hours thus enabling improved scheduling and prioritization of appointments.
                Electronic medical records (EMR) emulate a patient’s paper chart and contain the patient’s medical and treatment history from one medical practice into a digital version.
                Electronic health records (EHR) contain the totality of a patient’s health record, consist of the patient’s EMR from multiple doctors, and represent a long-term view of a patient's health in digital form. 

            Drug Development Technologies

            The pharmaceutical industry leans heavily on AI and machine learning (ML) to power a new wave of drug research and development by automating manual tasks such as combining certain chemicals to create the optimal drug.

            Surgical Technologies

            Surgical and recovery times are drastically reduced thanks to numerous technologies. Let’s look at a few common applications.

                Robotics removes the dependence of solely onsite doctors for care. Robotic surgical assistants are often used in tandem with an onsite doctor to perform processes from non-invasive procedures to open-heart surgery.
                Virtual reality (VR) allows aspiring surgeons the use of augmented VR (a real-life view of an experience projected onto a screen) to gain experience on conducting several different types of surgeries or practicing new surgical techniques.
                Three-dimensional (3D) printing increases the number of available organs for transplants. 3D printing is changing the world of organ transplants by allowing for the substitution of certain organs and artificial tissue with 3D printed solutions to replace or repair damage or structures in the body. 

            IoT Technologies

            IoT consists of a network of internet-connected objects able to collect and exchange data. The technology offers new opportunities for healthcare professionals to monitor patients, as well as patients to monitor themselves. Some examples of these health monitoring devices include connected inhalers and glucose monitoring.

                Connected inhalers help treat conditions such as asthma by monitoring a patient's frequency of attacks and collecting environmental data for their healthcare provider to understand what triggered the attack. These inhalers also alert patients if they leave inhalers at home or when they use the inhaler improperly.
                Glucose monitoring in diabetic patients has traditionally been difficult. Patient's have to manually check and record their glucose regularly often at inconvenient times. These checks typically represent a snapshot in time. IoT devices for glucose monitoring provide continuous, automatic monitoring of glucose levels and eliminate the need for manual record keeping, while alerting patients when their glucose levels are problematic. 

            Remote Patient Monitoring and Telehealth 

            These are probably the most common applications of healthcare IoT devices. These devices automatically collect health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, or temperature from implanted or wearable medical devices from patients not physically present in a healthcare facility. Software applications manage, save, and forward the collected data to a medical professional anywhere in the world where an internet connection and access to the application exist.

            Healthcare Cybersecurity Terminology

            With all these advancements in healthtech, cybersecurity has become more vital than ever for the healthcare sector. Yet cybersecurity threats to the healthcare industry are rapidly on the rise. Financially motivated criminal organizations and other threat actors continue to target the healthcare industry with ransomware attacks and data theft, which puts patient safety and privacy at risk. It’s therefore critical to view cybersecurity as a patient safety issue, enterprise risk, and strategic priority. Before we dive a bit deeper into these threats and risks, let’s learn about a few cybersecurity related terms the healthcare industry uses.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe the energy and utilities industry.
                Discuss the current energy and utilities industry outlook. 

            The Energy Industry at a Glance

            Before the industrial revolution, our energy needs were modest. For heat, we relied on the sun, or we burned wood and straw. For transportation, horses gave us mobility, and wind in our sails helped us explore the world.

            For a hundred years, energy consumers had one option for service. Utility companies didn’t have to compete for customers, and customers couldn’t shop around for utility services. Utilities offered one service, electricity, and everyone wanted it.

            Today, many customers have different options, including the type and source of energy they buy, and whom they buy it from. They can shop for rates and energy-efficient appliance rebates to suit their energy needs.

            In a deregulated market, customers enjoy greater freedom in shopping for utility services, because deregulation increases competition, and competition multiplies customer choice. This means multiple utility companies compete to provide better services to customers. As they say, competition in a market is always good for customers.

            Add customer demand to this. Today’s customer expects to engage their utility provider for other reasons, not just to report outages to the call center. Customers now want digital services such as:

                Status updates through social media
                Online bill payment
                Incentives and offers over self-service mobile channels 

            In fact, customers want to be informed through all available communication channels, such as text, email, and social media.

            They no longer depend solely on utilities for their energy needs, because they can get their energy from non-utility companies too. For instance, some tech and automobile companies are also offering utility services to consumers like never before.

            Consumers can also generate electricity themselves by using solar panels and wind turbines. So, utilities aren’t only competing with non-utility companies but also customers to own the energy-customer relationship.

            Most of the earth’s population relies on electricity, gas, and water supply. For this reason, the opportunities to serve billions of customers with better and faster services are endless.
            Energy and Utilities Industry Outlook

            The global energy and utilities industry includes three major categories of natural resources: electricity, natural gas, and water. The industry is responsible for the safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable generation, transmission, and distribution of these resources. The key industry segments are:

                Generation
                Transmission and distribution
                Customer or retail
                Water distribution
                Natural gas transmission and distribution 

            A power plant, solar panels, windmills, transmission tower, and a house.

            A value chain is the complete set of activities starting from energy generation, transmission, marketing, and finally distribution to retailers and customers. An efficient value chain creates economic value for customers, employees, and society at large.

            You need a robust distribution network to guarantee a stable supply of energy to customers. Energy production, marketing, and promotion are activities that are now open to competition. However, power distribution is still a cost-managed monopoly business in most parts of the world. Government-owned entities usually manage the power distribution business, which has a slightly different value chain compared to the privately managed ones.

            Renewable energy has been gaining momentum in the electricity industry as the infrastructure and logistics for generating electricity from renewable sources become cheaper and more accessible. Renewable energy uses naturally replenished sources, such as the sun, wind, water, the earth’s heat, and plants. Renewable energy plays an important role in the world’s energy security and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

            The energy and utilities industry faces several challenges, such as:

                New and more stringent regulations
                Nuclear vulnerability in some countries
                Security-related issues around the transport of raw materials 

            To grow in these conditions, companies must digitally transform, reorganize, and change their action plans. This means investing in new technologies and methodologies, including information analytics.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Identify the different types of utilities.
                Describe the types of utility, energy, and waste companies. 

            Utilities Basics

            Take a look at the three types of utility products and how utility companies work to produce the products and transport them to customers.
            Electricity

            Electricity starts with generation. Traditional power generators are utilities that produce electricity from fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy sources.

            This image shows the electricity production and distribution process.

            The electricity production and distribution process.

            After power is generated, it’s often transformed from low to high voltage, so that transmission lines can efficiently carry it over long distances. When power nears its final destination, distribution transformers convert high-voltage power back to low voltage and deliver it to customers at end usage points. Some large commercial and industrial customers draw power directly from transmission lines.

            In some markets, customers create their own power using distributed energy resources (DER) systems. DERs are small-scale power generation or storage systems located close to where the electricity is used, such as in a home or business.

            Energy retailers, also called vertically integrated utilities depending on the market, sell electricity to customers. Some customers generate and store their electricity on-site with photovoltaic (PV) solar panels, electric vehicles (EV), and microgrids. They can also sell their energy back to utilities.
            Gas

            Natural gas is a nonrenewable hydrocarbon gas used as a source of energy for heating, cooking, and electricity generation. The natural gas production journey involves several complex stages. First, companies extract fossil fuels and biofuels. Next, they process the fuels using odorification, compression, metering, and finally liquefaction. Lastly, companies sell the processed gas to the commodity market.

            This image shows the production and distribution process of natural gas.

            The natural gas production and distribution process.

            Transmission networks move high-pressure gas to large industrial customers, gas-powered electricity generators, or storage. Storage facilities hold the gas reserves.

            Distribution companies receive gas from transmission companies and deliver it to their customers. Depending on the market, distribution companies sometimes operate as a regulated monopoly or a competitive retail company. In a competitive gas market, retailers and gas suppliers sometimes purchase gas from the distributors and pay them to ship it to the customer's premises.
            Water

            In this image, observe how water is sourced and distributed to customers. The image also shows how utilities collect wastewater from customers and send it for treatment.

            Utilities source water from rivers and reservoirs, water-treatment plants, and service reservoirs by abstraction and treatment. They store the treated water in storage facilities before transporting it to customers.

            Similar to gas, in a deregulated water market, a retailer or utility company purchases water from the distributor and pays them to ship it through a clean water network for household or commercial consumption. The retailer has contracts with the customer and is responsible for billing water consumption and waste discharge. Wastewater is sent back into the system through a wastewater network for treatment and storage at sewage or sludge-treatment facilities.
            Types of Utility, Energy, and Waste Companies

            Now that you know more about how utilities function, examine the players that serve the utility service needs of customers. This section focuses on the electricity industry, but the gas and water industries have similar counterparts.
            Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution Companies

            Power generation, transmission, and distribution companies specialize in creating, transmitting, and distributing energy and utilities.

            A power plant, electricity transmission tower, electricity distribution pole, and a transformer.

            Power generation companies generate electric power from primary sources of energy, such as solar, wind, nuclear, coal, oil, and natural gas. For utilities in the electric power industry, power generation is the stage before storage or delivery to customers through transmission, distribution, and so forth.

            Transmission companies specialize in the bulk movement of electrical energy from a generating site to an electrical substation. At this point, distribution companies take over using interconnected lines known as a transmission network. The combined transmission and distribution network is commonly known as the Grid in North America and the National Grid in the United Kingdom, India, Tanzania, Myanmar, Malaysia, and New Zealand. Transmission companies are often combined with or serve as distribution companies.

            Distribution companies deliver electric power by carrying electricity from the transmission system to individual customers. Distribution substations connect to the high-voltage transmission system and use transformers to lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV.
            Electric Suppliers and Retailers

            Electric suppliers and retailers are companies that buy electricity from the commodity market and sell it to customers. In many countries, the electricity market has been deregulated to open up the supply of electricity to competition. The role of electricity retailing has changed from administrative in integrated utilities to revenue-generation and risk-management in today’s competitive electricity market.

            Electricity retailers now offer their customers fixed or variable prices for electricity and manage the risk involved in purchasing electricity from spot markets or electricity pools. In a deregulated market, also called a competitive or liberalized energy market, customers can:

                Choose from several competing electricity suppliers.
                Purchase electricity sourced from renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar.
                Buy other related products and services. 

            Electric Cooperatives

            Electric cooperatives (co-ops), are private, nonprofit utility businesses owned by the customers they serve. Co-ops provide at-cost electric service and are governed by an elected board of directors. The two types of cooperatives include distribution cooperatives and generation and transmission (G&T) cooperatives.

                Distribution cooperatives deliver electricity to their member-owners.
                G&Ts provide wholesale power to distribution co-ops through their own generation or by purchasing power on behalf of the distribution members. 

            Co-ops are typically established in rural areas that don’t have an investor-owned or municipal utility nearby to supply electric power. Examples of electric cooperatives include Great Lakes Energy Cooperative in Michigan and Dixie Power in Utah.
            Energy Services Companies

            Energy services companies (ESCOs) design, develop, build, and arrange financing for projects that save energy, reduce energy costs, and decrease operations and maintenance costs at their customers’ facilities. In general, ESCOs act as project developers for a comprehensive range of energy conservation measures (ECMs) and assume the technical and performance risks associated with a project.
            Investor-Owned Utilities

            Investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are privately owned electricity and natural gas providers that aim to produce a return for investors. IOUs distribute profits to stockholders or reinvest the profits. A public utilities commission regulates and sets the rate with some customer participation. IOUs purchase power through contracts and also have their own generation facilities. They’re the largest type of electric utility and have a complex mix of customers. Examples of IOUs include FirstEnergy in Ohio and Pacific Gas & Electric in California.
            Public Utilities

            Public or municipality-owned utilities are nonprofit local government agencies. They provide services to communities that recover costs and earn additional returns. Public utilities use the returns to invest in new facilities. Locally elected officials or public employees manage public utilities.

            Public utilities can return excess funds to customers through reduced rates, community contributions, and increased operational efficiencies. The utility governing body or city council sets the rates. Public utilities operate their own generation facilities or buy power through contracts. Examples of public utilities include Breckenridge Public Utilities in Minnesota and Burlington Electric Department in Vermont.
            Summary

            In this unit, you learned about the different types of utility products and how utility companies produce and distribute their products. You also got to know that many types of utility companies operate worldwide, including investor-owned, municipality-owned, and cooperatives. These companies strive to meet the energy, gas, water, and waste needs of communities.

            In the next unit, you learn how these companies operate within their markets.

            Discover Market Models and Their Impact on Utilities
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain the different types of global utility market models.
                Discuss the challenges that utilities face today.
                Describe the impact of processes required by key business units. 

            Types of Global Utility Market Models

            Energy markets across the world are in the middle of a revolution, triggered by decarbonization and fueled by innovation. Some countries have introduced energy deregulation and competition into energy markets, which has led to the creation of new types of energy markets. Here’s a look at some of the globally recognized energy market models.
            Regulated

            A stamp and document symbol.

            Utility companies in regulated markets, often called vertically integrated utilities, must show a return on investment or a benefit for the money they spend. In a regulated market, the utility companies own the infrastructure, which includes electric transmission lines and all the associated equipment, such as power poles, power lines, and transformers. These utility companies often generate or purchase electricity and sell it to customers.
            Regulated with Competition

            A stamp, document, and people symbol.

            Utilities in a regulated competitive market are similar to regulated utilities, but they face some level of energy supplier competition. This type of market model often caters to the customer base with higher usage or demand.

            Some regulated markets support a level of energy supplier competition. Utilities in regulated markets are often considered vertically integrated, which means they have a monopoly over the sale of power to their customers. But in many regions, utilities offer limited choices for some customer segments. Examples of such regions in the US include California, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, and Virginia.

            Sometimes residential customers buy power from the community or renewable-energy suppliers. In many cases, commercial and industrial (C&I) customers with high usage and demand buy power from energy suppliers that can meet their operational budgets and sustainability goals with clean energy.
            Transitioning

            A book with forward arrow transition symbol.

            Transitioning markets are now open to full-scale competition. However, these markets haven’t fully separated or unbundled all of the existing entities of the previously regulated market. Entities include generation, transmission, distribution, and retail.
            Competitive

            A document and people symbol.

            Competitive markets are also known as deregulated energy markets. In a competitive market, utility companies own and maintain the transmission infrastructure and distribute electricity, while other companies compete to supply and sell electricity and gas to customers.

            In a deregulated market, vertically integrated companies are split into multiple independent companies that focus on a specific aspect of the market. For example, a single vertically integrated utility company is split into generation, transmission and distribution, and energy supply companies, though this varies between markets. Additionally, services such as meter asset management and meter ownership are sometimes split into separate companies.

            The goals of energy deregulation typically include breaking up monopolies and encouraging energy supplier competition. This gives customers more options and encourages price competition. A successful deregulated market has some churn because customers mostly shop for competitive rates and offers that fit their needs and lifestyles.
            Challenges Facing Utilities

            The energy and utilities industries face many obstacles due to the current business environment. Consolidation is creating an increasing need to integrate, merge, and reconcile business-support systems. Here’s an overview of the industry environment and the challenges it presents.
            Deregulation

            Around the world, countries have introduced energy deregulation and competition into energy markets to democratize the energy and utilities industry and provide customers with choices. The more competitive a market, the more pressure on utilities to gain and retain customers.

            Deregulation:

                Increases customer choice and energy supplier competition to encourage competitive energy pricing.
                Unbundles generation, transmission, distribution, supply, and customer service.
                Helps break up monopolies over the end-to-end elements of electricity, gas, and water supply. 

            Aging Infrastructure and Workforce

            Along with competitive pressure, the energy and utilities sector is at an inflection point. Aging infrastructure needs replacement, and a new generation is entering the workforce. In addition to the physical infrastructure, aging and inflexible customer information systems (CIS) and billing systems can no longer handle the data and security requirements of changing markets.
            Retail Competition’s Effect on Energy Rates

            Competitive markets lead to price competition, and the commercial and industrial segments benefit the most. Even customers using default services provided by utilities in competitive regions still benefit from competitive markets, because competition leads to more choices.
            Climate Change and Environmental Responsibility

            Everybody's talking about climate change. The implementation of energy savings and efficiency measures, and the use of renewable energies, are constantly increasing. That’s why utility companies must rethink their strategies and shift their operations to reach greater levels of environmental stewardship and protection. When it comes to finding new ways to generate energy through sustainable processes, it’s now or never.

            Furthermore, energy sustainability measures open the door to major economic benefits. Sustainability measures can help generate mass amounts of information with valuable consumption and generation data to bring down costs.
            Digital Transformation

            Digital adoption and rapid technological change are forcing utilities to rethink their current business models, including how they work and the services they provide. To achieve greater sustainability and higher energy savings, utilities have to implement digitization strategies that facilitate the design, implementation, and operation of new sustainable technologies in which customers play a starring role.

            Customers expect to have a more fluid and personalized experience. What’s more, they want more information, with detailed data on their rates and consumption. Utilities must make their strategies customer-centric and digitize their processes and tools.
            Key Business Units and Processes

            The rules of the energy industry are changing as utilities embrace new technologies and customers gain more control over products. Examine some of the impacts of changes to business processes on customers and key business units.

            Accounting Rules Changes: Information Services

            Often, utilities in regulated markets are unable to capitalize on the money they spend on services in the same way that they can for capital equipment. Because regulated markets lack competition, utilities haven’t prioritized information services, such as cloud-computing solutions to support their business processes. However, this is changing as some utilities acknowledge the benefits provided by software as a service (SaaS).
            Utility Rules Changes: Who Creates Energy?

            Now customers really do have power, their own power. With rooftop solar, electric vehicles, batteries, and microgrids, customers can sell their power back to the grid. They can also get paid by utilities to reduce their consumption or use stored energy when grid capacity is strained.

            Distributed energy resources are a consideration and even a concern for grid operators who fear the impact of losing customers. But, if utilities and customers are aligned, distributed energy resources can work to the advantage of both utilities and customers to:

                Regulate the flow of electricity.
                Transition to cleaner energy.
                Keep the grid safe and secure.
                Reduce energy costs. 

            Grid Changes: Moving to Multidirectional

            Grid evolution is driving the need for cloud platforms because as the energy grid becomes more distributed and multidirectional, the enterprise platforms required to manage this flow of data and transactions must adapt.

            In the past, power flowed one way, and the system was focused on safe, reliable, and affordable power. New and disruptive innovations, such as distributed energy resources, are changing this. Power now flows two ways. Energy can be mobile and the computing needs to manage everything are far greater. New digital energy cloud platforms, such as Salesforce, are filling that need.

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain the common utility service processes.
                Describe the common customer notifications.
                Describe the energy and utilities units of measure.
                Define the pricing and quoting terms for various energy and utility commodities. 

            Common Energy and Utilities Service Processes

            Apart from delivering energy products to customers, utilities also provide additional services to make customers’ service experience better. Here are the most common energy and utilities service processes for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) customers.

            Examples of energy and utility services provided to the customers.
            Manage Communication Preferences and Services

            With so many channels of communication available, good customer service tailors the communication method to customer preferences. Whether it’s incoming or outgoing communications, utilities must manage their customer communications efficiently so that customers get what they need in a way that’s convenient for them.

            People and businesses move and change. Customer service agents communicate regularly with individuals who are moving to a different house and need their service changed. Agents also work with businesses that plan to move to a different location.

            Customers who own multiple properties need to organize their utilities efficiently. Easy access to real-time information and customer service are important to property managers.
            New Programs and Energy Services

            New programs and energy services are exciting topics for many customers and a chance for companies to build relationships. They share information with customers about new programs, such as solar, electric vehicles, batteries, and related offers and rebates.
            Bill Inquiry and Payment Assistance

            Customers sometimes call to ask questions about their bill or to submit a meter reading, but this need not be the end of the conversation. With the right tools, customer service agents can use this time to build a relationship with the customer. This includes suggesting ways for the customer to save or manage energy, which can help them save money.

            Customer service agents also reach out to customers about payments and sometimes about nonpayment of bills. This can lead to conversations about payment and collections assistance.
            Service Outage, Safety, and Service Callout

            Service outage and safety issue notifications are two-way communications. Customers can report a service outage or safety issue, and utilities can communicate a planned or unplanned service outage or safety issue to customers through several channels.

            When an equipment malfunctions, companies dispatch workers to the site to make repairs. Service can be planned or unplanned, and utilities inform the customers about any potential outages and expected restoration times.
            New Rates and Construction

            Whether fixed or variable, rates change from time to time. New rates and rate changes are sometimes available by choice or mandate. Customer service agents regularly reach out to customers about changes and rate choices through calls and digital channels.

            A lot goes on at new construction sites and not just for the general contractor. Utilities carry out many different actions at new construction sites, which they manage on a schedule to avoid disruptions in construction.
            Common Customer Notifications

            Now that you know the various common customer service tasks, it’s time to learn more about the common customer notifications.

            Examples of the service notifications that customers expect from utilities.
            Account Activation and Deactivation Services

            Customers sometimes move in and out of a utility’s service area, and they occasionally switch to a competitor as well. With current trends, it’s more common than ever for customers to contact their utilities to add, switch, and deactivate service.
            Welcome Communications

            When a new customer joins a utility service, it’s important to start the customer relationship with a communication to welcome them onboard. Examples include welcome calls, gifts, and emails.
            Electronic Fund Transfer Confirmations

            With identity theft on the rise, many customers are setting up regular notifications through their banks. Offering customers the option to set up electronic funds transfer (EFT) confirmations with the utilities helps build customer trust.
            Payment Reminders and Overdue Notices

            With busy schedules, sometimes customers overlook or forget to pay their bills. They like reminders to help them avoid additional fees and hits to their credit scores.
            Rate Change Notifications and Tariff Notices

            While this type of notification is sometimes mandated, utility customers on variable rates run their businesses to maximize output and minimize costs. So, it’s important to know the rates at all times. Some rates vary in price by time of day or usage, and customers want to know when they cross a threshold into a higher rate or price.
            Outage or Restoration Notifications

            Regardless of whether you service individual customers or businesses, it’s important for everyone experiencing an outage to know when repairs are underway and when service is restored. Often, outage notices include an estimated time of restoration.
            Crew Mobilization Notices

            Whenever there’s a service disruption, it’s important to notify customers. Companies must also notify all crew members to mobilize and restore service. Mobilization notices alert crews when they must repair damage or perform services.
            Customer Satisfaction Surveys

            As with any type of customer, utility customers don’t always share when they’re unhappy. So, it’s important to reach out to customers occasionally, to determine their level of satisfaction and improvement areas.
            Energy Product Measurements

            Guess what utility companies do before selling their commodities? If you said measure and price their products, you get a gold star. Learn about some of the primary energy units of measure and pricing terms.

            Electricity Units of Measure

            An energy unit used for electrical power, particularly for utility bills, is the kilowatt-hour (kWh), with one kilowatt-hour equivalent to 3.6 megajoules. Electricity usage is measured in units of kilowatt-hours per year or another time period. This is a measurement of average power consumption, meaning the average rate at which energy is transferred. One kilowatt-hour per year is about 0.11 watts.
            Natural Gas Units of Measure

            Natural gas is often sold in units of energy content or by volume. The most commonly used units of measure for gas are gas cubic feet or meters. Ccf or one hundred cubic feet and Mcf or one thousand cubic feet are used to measure large volumes of natural gas.
            Water, Wastewater, and Waste Units of Measure

            Water and wastewater are measured in gallons, cubic feet or meters, or centum cubic feet (CCF). Waste charges can be measured by weight or volume in skips, bins, dumpsters, or other containers, depending on the content of the waste.
            Energy and Utilities Pricing and Quoting Terms

            Energy and utility companies employ usage pricing extensively. The four subtypes of pricing include unit rate, standing charge, interval pricing, and Flex pricing.
            Summary

            In this unit, you learned how utilities communicate with their customers and how customer expectations are changing rapidly. You got to know about some of the common notifications that utilities send to their customers. In the end, you also learned about the various energy units of measure and pricing terms.

            In the next unit, you learn about the transformative shifts in the energy market and the impact of distributed energy resources and demand-side management.

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Define the four Ds of energy transformation.
                Explain the factors driving digital transformation for energy and utility companies.
                Describe the impact of distributed energy resources and demand-side management on the energy market. 

            The Four Ds of Energy Transformation

            Transformative shifts are taking place in the energy and utilities industries, including deregulation, decentralization, and distributed energy resources (DER). Moreover, decarbonization, digitalization, and demand-side management are intensifying the shift. Energy transformation is defined by four Ds: decarbonization, deregulation, digitalization, and decentralization. Here’s a closer look at each of these processes.
            Decarbonization

            Decarbonization is the move to cleaner energy and conservation behavior. This move changes the technologies used to generate power, such as wind and solar. In turn, the changes impact the infrastructure of the business as well as the products available to customers. Types of products resulting from decarbonization include green energy and renewable-based products. As a result, these changes affect customer-facing sales and service opportunities.
            Deregulation

            Deregulated markets are moving away from verticalized utilities. Thanks to this shift, new market models are emerging in which nontraditional energy companies can now own the energy-customer relationship. As a result, traditional utility companies need new products and systems to support existing products and compete successfully. This means increased demands on their systems.
            Digitalization

            Digitalization includes using the cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and big data to build smarter, more responsive grids, with an additional focus on customer behavior. Customers are now used to the sophisticated digital services offered in other industries and expect the same from their utility companies. You learn more about digital transformation later in this unit.
            Decentralization

            With more on-site customer generation and distributed energy resources, such as solar power, EVs, microgrids, and battery storage, customers have more choice and power over the grid than ever. While this seems positive for customers, it places a new and increased burden on keeping a utility’s infrastructure safe, as the utility no longer owns, maintains, or physically controls all the energy resources that are now part of its energy grid.
            What’s Driving Digital Transformation?

            As the energy industry evolves, customer expectations and utility innovations become increasingly varied. Take a look at some of the questions utilities ask as they try to meet the demands of the new-age energy industry.
            Customer Expectations and Value

            As a utility company, how do I keep up? How do I personalize my products and communications for my vastly diverse customer base? How do I meet the customers where they want to be and anticipate their needs? How do I provide true value to my customers?
            Digital-First, Work-from-Anywhere, Real-Time

            How do I deliver a digital-first experience for my customers and employees, connecting them from anywhere? Can I be agile enough? Can I generate insights and enable actions in real time that are valuable to my customers and that support our business objectives?
            Disruptive Regulatory and Technology Change

            How will the industry landscape look in a competitive market, with new distributed, democratized, and decarbonized energy programs? How do I use IoT, smart devices, meters, and VPPs or networks to maximize grid, customer, and business value? What’s my place in new energy market models?

            Salesforce solutions support all types of utility market models across the globe and are flexible enough to meet the different expectations and innovations of each market.
            Impact of Distributed Energy Resources

            DERs are electrical generation and storage facilities that consist of a variety of small, grid-connected, or distribution-system-connected devices. Distributed generation and storage enable the collection of energy from many sources, lower environmental impacts, and improve the security of supply.

            A windmill, solar panel, and battery.

            Conventional power stations, such as coal-fired and gas stations, nuclear-powered plants, hydroelectric dams, and large-scale solar power stations, are centralized and often transmit electric energy over long distances.

            In contrast to conventional power stations, DER systems are decentralized, modular, and use flexible technologies that are located close to the load they serve. However, DERs have capacities of only 10 megawatts (MW) or less. Multiple generation and storage components can form these systems, which are sometimes referred to as hybrid power systems.

            DER systems typically use renewable energy sources, such as hydro, biomass, biogas, sun, wind, and geothermal. DERs play an important role in the electric power distribution system as the energy industry moves towards renewable energy.
            Grid-Connected Devices

            A grid-connected device for electricity storage can also be classified as a DER system and is called a distributed energy storage system (DESS). DER systems can be managed and coordinated in a smart grid through an interface.
            Microgrids

            Microgrids are modern, localized, small-scale grids, as opposed to the traditional, centralized electricity grid or macrogrid. DERs can be the components of a microgrid. Think of a microgrid as a small, standalone grid, capable of meeting the energy needs of a defined area, such as a community or an area of several city blocks. To be self-sufficient in the provision of energy, a microgrid needs one or more sources of energy.

            In the past, a microgrid has included resources such as a diesel generator, but with technological advances, resources now include DERs, such as solar or wind. On a larger scale, microgrids also add efficient batteries to the mix to store energy.

            Microgrids can disconnect from the centralized grid and operate autonomously, strengthen grid resilience, and help mitigate grid disturbances. They’re typically low-voltage AC grids that use diesel generators and are installed by the community they serve. Microgrids nowadays employ a mixture of different DERs, such as solar hybrid power systems, which significantly reduce carbon emissions.
            Impact of Demand-Side Management

            Demand-side management (DSM) is a group of actions designed to efficiently manage a site’s energy consumption to cut the costs incurred for the supply of electrical energy. Costs arise from grid charges and general system charges, including taxes.

            One way utilities can meet the demand on the grid is to reduce demand from the customer side by influencing customer consumption. The energy you save is measured in negawatts. No, it's not a joke. A negawatt is a hypothetical unit of power for measuring the amount of energy saved due to efficient energy consumption. A negawatt is the cheapest electron because it’s the one you don't use.

            Utilities use conservation or energy-efficiency programs to help customers commit to using little or no energy during certain peak times, which allows the utility company to keep reserve power plants shut down. Without these programs, utilities often fire up reserve plants to meet customer demand. For instance, when all of the air conditioners switch on at the same time in a Los Angeles heat wave.

            DSM optimization aims to achieve savings in electricity charges by modifying features of electricity consumption related to the:

                Overall consumption picture
                Consumption time profile
                Contractual supply parameters, including contractual power and grid connection parameters 

            As a result of the high penetration of renewable sources and the decentralization of production sources, grid managers in many countries now see increased instability on the grid and consequent disruptions to services.
            Grid Services

            Grid managers can use generation and consumption systems that offer grid services to limit the impact of service disruptions and ensure a balance between energy consumption and the amount of power fed into the grid. To engage in demand-side management, the first requirement is to carry out an in-depth analysis of onsite consumption. This involves assessing the unique requirements of each site and whether utilities can optimize the consumption habits of customers.

            Whenever a change in habit is unfeasible or simply insufficient to achieve the desired cost reductions, utilities can evaluate these on-site installation elements.

                Battery energy storage systems (BESS)
                Renewable source systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines
                Cogeneration systems

            Time to Get Fluent in AI

            Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a dream of many storytellers and sci-fi fans for years. But for a long time most people hadn’t given AI much serious thought because it was always something that might happen far into the future. Well, researchers and computer scientists haven’t been waiting for tomorrow to arrive, they’ve been working hard to make the dream of AI into a reality. In fact, some have said we’ve already entered the Age of AI.

In the foreground is a college student typing on computer, drawn in the style of fun 2D vector artwork.”]

            It’s unclear just how deeply AI will become part of our daily lives. But what is certain is that for us to have meaningful conversations about AI, we need a shared vocabulary and a solid foundation of core concepts to build upon. As it stands, if you ask 10 people to define artificial intelligence, you’re likely to get 10 different answers. In this badge we try to reach an agreed-upon definition by exploring AI’s current capabilities. We also investigate how computer scientists create the AI systems that perform such incredible feats.

            The Difficulty of Defining AI

            The first step in defining AI is to recognize that our current notion of AI might be a little distorted. A steady diet of science fiction books and movies where AI is seen as a nefarious entity bent on conquering the world hasn’t helped.

            Science fiction isn’t the only thing that’s complicated our view of AI. Generally speaking, we humans tend to think quite highly of ourselves; the benchmark by which everything else is measured. So when we speak of artificial intelligence, we can’t help but to compare it to our own intelligence. The problem is that humans aren’t the only intelligent beings out there. Animals, from crows to octopuses, use tools and problem solving to perform complex tasks. Even slime molds can solve mazes if given enough time.

            And as we’ve begun to appreciate the huge spectrum of intelligence in the animal kingdom, we’ve also started to recognize the great diversity in our own human intelligence. Maybe you’ve met someone who’s fantastic at public speaking but can’t do math to save their life. Or someone who can always tell when you’re feeling a little anxious, but would trip over a soccer ball at the first opportunity. The point is that our intelligence is expressed in many, specialized forms. We need to think of artificial intelligence in the same way. There are specific kinds of AI that are good at specific kinds of tasks. So let’s bring some definition to what we mean by artificial intelligence by taking a close look at what AI can do today.

            Main Types of AI Capabilities

            Right now there’s no singular AI that’s good at everything. That idea, known as general AI, is still far into the future. Instead, over the years we’ve developed several specialized AI systems that are designed to perform specific tasks. The kinds of tasks they do generally fall into one of a few broader categories.

            Numeric Predictions

            Have you looked at a weather forecast recently? Predicting rain or shine helps you decide if you should grab an umbrella. Although we’ve made weather predictions for thousands of years, AI can do it better than any previous method.

            A good prediction can help you answer all sorts of questions. Is this customer likely to renew their subscription? Are you at risk for a medical condition? Will there be high demand on the power grid this evening?

            Often AI predictions take the form of a value between 0 (not going to happen) to 1 (totally going to happen). Numeric predictions include more than just percent values, they can predict any numeric value, such as dollars. Maybe your business wants to predict next quarter’s sales, or figure out the optimal pricing for your latest service: Widget+. And as a consumer you’re probably already affected by these kinds of numeric predictions, even more than you realize. Just imagine a trip overseas: the airline tickets, hotel room, ridesharing, and travelers insurance are all likely to be priced by AI to perfectly balance supply and demand.

            The Trick Behind the Magic

            What AI can do may seem like magic. And like magic, it’s natural to want a peek behind the curtain to see how it’s all done. What you’ll find is that computer scientists and researchers are using lots of data, math, and processing power in place of mirrors and misdirection. Learning how AI actually works will help you use it to its fullest potential, while avoiding pitfalls due to its limitations.
            The Shift from Crafting to Training

            For decades, programmers have written code that takes an input, processes it using a set of rules, and returns an output. For example, here’s how to find the average from a set of numbers.

                Input: 5, 8, 2, 9 
                Process: Add the values [5 + 8 + 2 + 9] then divide by the number of inputs [4]
                Output: 6  

            This simple set of rules for turning an input into an output is an example of an algorithm. Algorithms have been written to perform some pretty sophisticated tasks. But some tasks have so many rules (and exceptions) that it’s impossible to capture them all in a hand-crafted algorithm. Swimming is a good example of a task that is hard to encapsulate as a set of rules. You might get some advice before jumping in the pool, but you only really figure out what works once you’re trying to keep your head above water. Some things are learned best by experience.

            What if we could train a computer in the same way? Not by tossing it into a pool, but by letting it figure out what works to succeed at a task? But just like learning to swim is very different from learning to speak a foreign language, the kind of training depends on the task. Let’s check out a few of the ways AI is trained.
            Experience Required

            Imagine that every time you went to the store to pick up milk, you tracked details of the trip in a spreadsheet. It’s a little weird, but go with it. You set up the following columns.

                Is it the weekend?
                Time of day
                Is it raining or not?
                Distance to store
                Total minutes of trip 

            After several trips you start getting a feel for how conditions affect how long it’ll take. Like, rain makes the drive longer, but it also means fewer people are shopping. Your brain makes connections between the inputs (weekend [W], time [T], raining [R], distance [D]) and the output (minutes [M]).

            Diagram of inputs [W, T, R, D

            But how can we get a computer to notice trends in the data so it can estimate too? One way is the guess-and-check method. Here’s how you do it.

            Step 1: Assign all of your inputs a “weight.” This is a number that represents how strongly an input should affect the output. It’s OK to start with the same weight for everything.

            Step 2: Use the weights with your existing data (and some clever math we won’t get into here) to estimate the minutes for a milk run. We can compare the estimate to the historic data. It’ll be way off, but that’s OK.

            Step 3: Let the computer guess a new weight for each input, making some a little more important than others. For example, the time of day might be more important than whether or not it’s raining.

            Step 4: Rerun the calculations to check if the new weights result in a better estimate. If so, it means the weights are a better fit, and changing in the right direction.

            Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4, letting the computer tweak weights until its estimates aren’t getting any better.

            At this point the computer has settled on weights for each input. If you think of weight as how strongly an input is connected to the output, you can make a diagram that uses line-thickness to represent the weight of a connection.

            Diagram of input nodes connected to an output.

            For this example it looks like the time of day has the strongest connection, but apparently rain doesn’t make much of a difference.

            This process of guess-and-check has created a model of our milk runs. And like a model boat, we can take it to the pool to see if it floats, so to speak. That means testing it in the real world. So for your next several milk runs, before you leave, have the model estimate how long it’ll take. If it’s right enough times in a row, you can confidently let it do the estimating for every future trip.

            A robot is at a workbench putting together the pieces of a small model sailboat. The picture is drawn in 2D vector art style.

            Use the Right Data for the Right Job

            This is a very simple example of using training to make an AI model, but it touches on some important ideas. First, it’s an example of machine learning (ML), which is the process of using large amounts of data to train a model to make predictions, instead of handcrafting an algorithm.

            Second, not all data is the same. In our milk run example, the spreadsheet is what we would call structured data. It is well organized, with labels on every column so you know the significance of every cell. In contrast, unstructured data would be something like a news article, or an unlabeled image file. The kind of data that you have available will affect what kind of training you can do.

            Third, the structured data from our spreadsheet lets computers do supervised learning. It’s considered supervised because we can make sure every piece of input data has a matching, expected output that we can verify. Conversely, unstructured data is used for unsupervised learning, which is when AI tries to find connections in the data without really knowing what it’s looking for.

            Letting the computer figure out a single weight for each input is just one kind of training regimen. But often interconnected systems are more complicated than what 1-to-1 weighting can represent. Thankfully, as you learn in the next unit, there are other ways to train!

            The Need for Neural Networks

            No conversation about AI is complete without mentioning neural networks. Neural networks are important tools for training AI models, so it’s good to have some idea of what they are. But before we get into the details, let’s first discuss why we need neural networks in the first place.

            In the previous unit, you learned that we can train an AI model by letting it guess-and-check the importance-weight of each input. But the milk run example was actually overly simplified. Our model would give us pretty rough estimates. To understand why, let’s consider two scenarios.

                It’s raining on a Tuesday evening. You’d rather not get wet, so you (and many others like you) decide shopping can wait until tomorrow. In this scenario, rain is a significant factor.
                It’s raining on Saturday afternoon. For many people, this is the only time of week when they can go shopping. So the store will be busy, rain or shine. In this scenario, rain doesn’t make much difference. 

            The problem is that our original model can only assign one weight to rain, but we know it’s more complicated than that. There is a solution, though, and it starts by representing the two scenarios in two separate graphs. Again, line thickness shows importance. In the first, “weekend” and “time” are weak, while “rain” is strong. For the second, “weekend” is strong, while “time” and “rain” is weak.

            Two diagrams, each connecting “weekend,” “time,” and “rain” to separate estimates. (gray, blue, yellow)

            We know these two scenarios are significant because we’re smart and have experience buying milk. But a computer just starting to learn about milk runs doesn’t know anything yet! It has to consider many scenarios: weekend-evening-rain, weekday-morning-shine, and so forth. Instead of two graphs, eight might better represent the kinds of scenarios you encounter.

            Eight very similar graphs, each have three nodes connected to one.

            That’s a lot of very similar graphs. Since the three inputs always represent “weekend,” “time,” and “rain,” you can overlap them. If you move the outputs so they aren’t touching, you get a combined graph that looks like this.

            A graph with three nodes on one side, and eight on the other. Every node is connected with a line.

            The importance of each scenario depends on the specific inputs. But knowing the importance is only half the battle. Each scenario needs to affect the final estimate in its own way.

            For example, the weekend-afternoon-shine milk run should take much longer. So let’s give it an adjustment of +5. When we do the math to calculate an estimate, it results in a larger number. While we’re at it, let’s give the weekday-morning-rain scenario an adjustment of -4 since we know milk runs are shortest at that time.

            Each scenario gets its own adjustment, which is what we call a bias. In this case, bias is a good thing because it helps us get a more accurate estimate. Let’s redraw our graph to include the bias of each scenario.

            A graph with three nodes on one side, and eight on the other, each with its own positive or negative number. Every node is connected with a line.

            So what do we do with these eight scenarios and their biases? Using some more clever math, we can combine them into a final estimate. Some scenarios should contribute more than others, so you guessed it, we need more weights! We can update our graph to show how the scenarios connect to the final estimate with different strengths.

            A graph with three nodes on the left side, eight in the middle, and one on the right. Lines connect left to middle, and middle to right.

            This is our new model. More connections will hopefully mean better estimates. This web of connections, guided by weights and biases, is an example of a neural network. We call it that because the connections, forged by experience (data), resemble how the neurons in a brain are connected.

            And while scenario is a good beginner word for describing a unique combination of factors, we should really use the word node for that concept. It’s what AI experts use, so moving forward we’ll use it too.
            Adding Complexity to Neural Networks

            Our new milk run model is a pretty basic example of a neural network. In practice, they can get quite complex. Let’s explore some of the ways researchers set up neural networks to get better results for specific tasks.

            First, you might be wondering why we chose eight nodes to stand between our inputs and output. There’s actually some flexibility in that number. We know that having no nodes at all will give us rough estimates. In the same way, having too few might not capture all of the nuance of the system we’re trying to model. But having too many nodes is a problem, too. We don’t want to make the computer do more calculations than necessary. So there’s a sweet spot for the number of nodes where we get good results for the least effort. Choosing the right number is part of designing a good neural network.

            There’s something else we can do to make artificial neural networks more like our own, organic ones. It has to do with how our minds often leap from idea to idea to find connections between two things that are not obviously related. Some of the most brilliant insights are the result of several leaps. So, what if we could make a neural network that could make more leaps, too? We can! We do it by adding more nodes as layers, connecting each node to its neighbor.

            Diagram of a neural network with two layers of nodes between inputs and outputs.

            Training AI by adding extra layers to find hidden meaning in data is what’s called deep learning. Thanks to an abundance of computing power, many neural networks are designed to have multiple layers. Again, the best number of layers is a balance between the number of calculations required and the quality of results they produce.
            More Than Mental Math, It’s Neural Network Math

            So, about those calculations. Up to this point we’ve glossed over the math part of training neural networks. That’s for a few reasons. First, the math can get really complicated, really fast. For example, here’s a snippet of a research paper about neural networks.

            Screenshot of a highly technical research paper about neural networks

            Yeah, it’s intense!

            Second, the exact math is going to depend on what kind of task you’re training the neural network to do. Third, each new research paper updates the math as we learn what works better at training different models.

            So, designing a neural network involves choosing the number of nodes, layers, and the appropriate math for the task it’s training for. With the model architecture ready, you have to let the computer use all that fancy math to do its guess-and-check routine. Eventually it’ll figure out the best weights and biases to give good estimates.

            And this brings us to something that’s a little unsettling about artificial neural networks. Imagine a skilled talent scout who’s looking for the next great baseball player. “I’ll know him when I see him,” they might say. They can’t explain how they’ll know, they just will. In the same way, our neural network can’t explain why certain factors are important. Sure, we can look at the values attached to each weight and bias, but the relevance of a number that’s the result of a connection of a connection of a connection will be lost to us.

            So just like how the mind of the talent scout is a black box, so is our neural network. Because we don’t observe the layers between the input and output, they’re referred to as hidden layers.
            Wrap Up

            To summarize, neural networks are a mix of nodes, layers, weights, biases, and a bunch of math. Together they mimic our own organic neural networks. Each neural network is carefully tuned for a specific task. Maybe it’s great at predicting rain, maybe it categorizes plants, or maybe it keeps your car centered in the lane on the highway. Whatever the task, neural networks are a big part of what makes AI seem magical. And now you know a little bit about how the trick is done.

            Classifications

            Is a hot dog a sandwich? This question has led to countless hours of friendly philosophical debate about how we categorize things. But in the real world, the stakes can be much higher. Is this plant edible or poisonous? Is that email legitimate or a phishing attempt? Classification is often the first step in taking some kind of action, making it an incredibly valuable skill.

            So it isn’t surprising that computer scientists have worked hard to create AI that’s good at classifying data. Identifying plants and phishing emails is only the tip of the iceberg. Financial institutions need to flag fraudulent transactions. Medical professionals must diagnose illnesses. Social media platforms want to identify toxic comments. All of these are examples of classification problems. AI can effectively make the first pass at classifying, and then the professionals can take it from there.

            Often, AI classifiers can do the job just as well, or better, than humans. That said, each classifier is only good at one, narrow task. So the AI that’s great at detecting phishing emails would be lousy at identifying pictures of actual fish.

            Robotic Navigation

            Some AIs excel at navigating a changing environment, and that might mean actual navigation in the case of autonomous (hands-free) driving. AI-powered cars are already quite capable of keeping centered in a lane and following at a safe distance on the highway. They adapt to curves in the road, gusts of wind from semi trucks, and sudden stops due to traffic.

            AI that can adapt to changing environmental conditions have all sorts of real-world applications. For example, businesses need to produce and deliver products to their customers every day. Lots of market conditions play a role in how quickly that gets done: materials availability, manufacturing capacity, existing inventory, transportation costs, even real-time traffic. AI can optimize the supply chain even while conditions are changing.

            And let’s not forget robots! Even the modest robot floor sweeper can avoid stairs and chairs. On a bigger scale, assembly lines are being fitted with robots that become faster and more efficient over time. Those same robots can adjust for changes to the production method without costly reprogramming. And researchers are creating rescue robots that can traverse disaster areas, such as a collapsed building. A robot-caterpillar that can squeeze through tiny cracks could deliver aid and hope to those trapped inside.

            Language Processing

            On November 30, 2022, Merriam-Webster’s word of the day was quiddity. Those who learned that word got a little better at what might be the most important skill of all: communication. On that same day, the world was introduced to ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence that demonstrated its own communication skills. It could write long responses to questions about almost any topic. And the responses seemed like they were written by a human. ChatGPT is one of the most capable AIs built to interpret everyday language and act on it in some meaningful way. This is known in the industry as natural language processing, or just NLP.

            Natural language processing relies on an understanding of how words are used together, and that lets AI extract the intention behind the words. For example, you might want to translate a document from English to German. Or maybe you want a short summary of a long, scientific paper. AI can do that too.

            NLP is a huge part of generative AI, a subcategory of AI that takes words and turns them into unique images, sounds, and of course other words. Generative AI is such a disruptive technology that we’ve devoted a whole badge to Generative AI Basics. Check it out when you’re done here.

            In Summary

            Artificial intelligence can be thought of as the ability for a computer to perform skills typically associated with human intuition, inference, and reasoning. At this time, AI skills are very specialized, and fall into some broad categories like numeric predictions and language processing.

            Now that you have a sense of what AI is (and isn’t), you’re ready to explore how computer scientists and researchers create AI.

            Streamline Customer Service with Automation
            Learning Objectives 

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain how automation makes your entire service team more efficient and your customers happier.
                Describe how to map business problems to automation solutions.
                List Service Cloud features you can use to automate service tasks. 

            What’s Automation for Service?

            Customer service is about providing a smooth and simple journey that meets each customer’s needs. It often takes many steps, agents, and systems to complete that journey. Automation helps to streamline the process. 

            For example, what if you could automate a repetitive task, like entering customer details only once and having them show up wherever they’re needed across the company? This process saves time for the customer and service team while ensuring accuracy. Likewise, automating complex processes across your entire business ensures that your team has the tools they need when customers are sent to the next stage in their journey.

            Here’s a quick video overview of the service experience. While you watch it, think about how this service journey is automated and ways you could adapt it to your business.

            What Is Natural Language Processing?

            Natural language processing (NLP), is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that combines computer science and linguistics to give computers the ability to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that’s meaningful and useful to humans.

            NLP helps computers perform useful tasks like understanding the meaning of sentences, recognizing important details in text, translating languages, answering questions, summarizing text, and generating responses that resemble human responses.

            NLP is already so commonplace in our everyday lives that we usually don’t even think about it when we interact with it or when it does something for us. For example, maybe your email or document creation app automatically suggests a word or phrase you could use next. You may ask a virtual assistant, like Siri, to remind you to water your plants on Tuesdays. Or you might ask Alexa to tell you details about the last big earthquake in Chile for your daughter’s science project.

            The chatbots you engage with when you contact a company’s customer service use NLP, and so does the translation app you use to help you order a meal in a different country. Spam detection, your online news preferences, and so much more rely on NLP.
            A Very Brief History of NLP

            It’s worth mentioning that NLP is not new. In fact, its roots wind back to the 1950s when researchers began using computers to understand and generate human language. One of the first notable contributions to NLP was the Turing Test. Developed by Alan Turing, this test measures a machine’s ability to answer any question in a way that’s indistinguishable from a human. Shortly after that, the first machine translation systems were developed. These were sentence- and phrase-based language translation experiments that didn’t progress very far because they relied on very specific patterns of language, like predefined phrases or sentences.

            A 1950s mainframe-style computer being operated by a computer scientist.

            By the 1960s, researchers were experimenting with rule-based systems that allowed users to ask the computer to complete tasks or have conversations.

            The 1970s and 80s saw more sophisticated knowledge-based approaches using linguistic rules, rule-based reasoning, and domain knowledge for tasks like executing commands and diagnosing medical conditions.

            Statistical approaches (i.e., learning from data) to NLP were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, leading to advances in speech recognition, machine translation, and machine algorithms. During this period, the introduction of the World Wide Web in 1993 made vast amounts of text-based data readily available for NLP research.

            A stack of papers and books.

            Since about 2009, neural networks and deep learning have dominated NLP research and development. NLP areas of translation and natural language generation, including the recently introduced ChatGPT, have vastly improved and continue to evolve rapidly.

            Human Language Is “Natural” Language

            What is natural language anyway? Natural language refers to the way humans communicate with each other using words and sentences. It’s the language we use in conversations, when we read, write, or listen. Natural language is the way we convey information, express ideas, ask questions, tell stories, and engage with each other. While NLP models are being developed for many different human languages, this module focuses on NLP in the English language.

            If you completed the Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals badge, you learned about unstructured data and structured data. These are important terms in NLP, too. Natural language–the way we actually speak–is unstructured data, meaning that while we humans can usually derive meaning from it, it doesn’t provide a computer with the right kind of detail to make sense of it. The following paragraph about an adoptable shelter dog is an example of unstructured data.

            Tala is a 5-year-old spayed, 65-pound female husky who loves to play in the park and take long hikes. She is very gentle with young children and is great with cats. This blue-eyed sweetheart has a long gray and white coat that will need regular brushing. You can schedule a time to meet Tala by calling the Troutdale shelter.

            For a computer to understand what we mean, this information needs to be well-defined and organized, similar to what you might find in a spreadsheet or a database. This is called structured data. The information included in structured data and how the data is formatted is ultimately determined by algorithms used by the desired end application. For example, data for a translation app is structured differently than data for a chatbot. Here’s how the data in the paragraph above might look as structured data for an app that can help match dogs with potential adopters.

                Name: Tala
                Age: 5
                Spayed or Neutered: Spayed
                Sex: Female
                Breed: Husky
                Weight: 65 lbs.
                Color: Gray and white
                Eye color: Blue
                Good with children: Yes
                Good with cats: Yes
                Favorite activities: Parks, hikes
                Location: Troutdale 

            Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation

            Today’s NLP matured with its two subfields, natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG). Data processed from unstructured to structured is called natural language understanding (NLU). NLU uses many techniques to interpret written or spoken language to understand the meaning and context behind it. You learn about these techniques in the next unit.

            Data processed the reverse way–from structured to unstructured–is called natural language generation (NLG). NLG is what enables computers to generate human-like language. NLG involves the development of algorithms and models that convert structured data or information into meaningful, contextually appropriate, natural-like text or speech. It also includes the generation of code in a programming language, such as generating a Python function for sorting strings.

            In the past, NLU and NLG tasks made use of explicit linguistic structured representations like parse trees. While NLU and NLG are still critical to NLP today, most of the apps, tools, and virtual assistants we communicate with have evolved to use deep learning or neural networks to perform tasks from end-to-end. For instance, a neural machine translation system may translate a sentence from, say, Chinese, directly into English without explicitly creating any kind of intermediate structure. Neural networks recognize patterns, words, and phrases to make language processing exponentially faster and more contextually accurate.

            In the next unit, you learn more about our natural language methods and techniques that enable computers to make sense of what we say and respond accordingly.

            Learn About Natural Language Parsing
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Discuss the basic elements of natural language.
                Describe several important techniques used when parsing natural language.
                Explain how sentiment, intent, and context analysis contribute to NLP. 

            Basic Elements of Natural Language

            Understanding and processing natural language is a fundamental challenge for computers. That's because it involves not only recognizing individual words, but also comprehending their relationships, their context, and their meaning.

            Our natural language, in text and speech, is characterized by endless complexity, nuances, ambiguity, and mistakes. In our everyday communication, we encounter words with several meanings; words that sound the same but are spelled differently and have different meanings; misplaced modifiers; misspellings; and mispronunciations. We also encounter people who speak fast, mumble, or who take forever to get to the point; and people who use speech patterns in accents or dialects that are different from ours.

            Take this sentence for example:

            “We saw six bison on vacation in Yellowstone National Park.”

            You might giggle a little as you imagine six bison in hats and sunglasses posing for selfies in front of Old Faithful. But, most likely, you understand what actually happened–that is, that someone who was on vacation in Yellowstone National Park saw six bison.

            Or this:

            “They swam out to the buoy.”

            If you heard someone speak this sentence without any context, you may think the people involved swam out to a male child, when in fact, they swam out to a marker in the water. The pronunciation of “boy” and “buoy” is slightly different, but the enunciation is not always made clear.

            While humans are able to flex and adapt to language fairly easily, training a computer to consider these kinds of nuances is quite difficult.

            Elements of natural language in English include:

                Vocabulary: The words we use
                Grammar: The rules governing sentence structure
                Syntax: How words are combined to form sentences according to grammar
                Semantics: The meaning of words, phrases, and sentences
                Pragmatics: The context and intent behind cultural or geographic language use
                Discourse and dialogue: Units larger than a single phrase or sentence, including documents and conversations
                Phonetics and phonology: The sounds we make when we communicate
                Morphology: How parts of words can be combined or uncombined to make new words 

            Parsing Natural Language

            Teaching a computer to read and derive meaning from words is a bit like teaching a child to read–they both learn to recognize words, their sounds, meaning, and pronunciation. But when a child learns to read, they usually have the advantage of context from a story; visual cues from illustrations; and relationships to things they already know, like trees or animals. They also often get assistance and encouragement from experienced readers, who help explain what they’re learning. These cues help new readers identify and attach meaning to words and phrases that they can generalize to other things they read in the future.

            We know that computers are a different kind of smart, so while a computer needs to understand the elements of natural language described above, the approach needs to be much more scientific. NLP uses algorithms and methods like large language models (LLMs), statistical models, machine learning, deep learning, and rule-based systems to process and analyze text. These techniques, called parsing, involve breaking down text or speech into smaller parts to classify them for NLP. Parsing includes syntactic parsing, where elements of natural language are analyzed to identify the underlying grammatical structure, and semantic parsing which derives meaning.

            As mentioned in the last unit, natural language is parsed in different ways to match intended outcomes. For example, natural language that’s parsed for a translation app uses different algorithms or models and is parsed differently than natural language intended for a virtual assistant like Alexa.

            Syntactic parsing may include:

                Segmentation: Larger texts are divided into smaller, meaningful chunks. Segmentation usually occurs at the end of sentences at punctuation marks to help organize text for further analysis.
                Tokenization: Sentences are split into individual words, called tokens. In the English language, tokenization is a fairly straightforward task because words are usually broken up by spaces. In languages like Thai or Chinese, tokenization is much more complicated and relies heavily on an understanding of vocabulary and morphology to accurately tokenize language.
                Stemming: Words are reduced to their root form, or stem. For example breaking, breaks, or unbreakable are all reduced to break. Stemming helps to reduce the variations of word forms, but, depending on context, it may not lead to the most accurate stem. Look at these two examples that use stemming: 

            “I’m going outside to rake leaves.”

            Stem = leave 

            “He always leaves the key in the lock.”

            Stem = leave 

                Lemmatization: Similar to stemming, lemmatization reduces words to their root, but takes the part of speech into account to arrive at a much more valid root word, or lemma. Here are the same two examples using lemmatization: 

            “I’m going outside to rake leaves.”

            Lemma = leaf 

            “He always leaves the key in the lock.”

            Lemma = leave 

                Part of speech tagging: Assigns grammatical labels or tags to each word based on its part of speech, such as a noun, adjective, verb, and so on. Part of speech tagging is an important function in NLP because it helps computers understand the syntax of a sentence.
                Named entity recognition (NER): Uses algorithms to identify and classify named entities–like people, dates, places, organizations, and so on–in text to help with tasks like answering questions and information extraction. 

            Semantic Analysis

            Parsing natural language using some or all of the steps we just described does a pretty good job of capturing the meaning of text or speech. But it lacks soft skill nuances that make human language, well, human. Semantic parsing involves analyzing the grammatical format of sentences and relationships between words and phrases to find the meaning representation. Extracting how people feel, why they are engaging, and details about circumstances surrounding an interaction all play a crucial role in accurately deciphering text or speech and forming an appropriate response.

            Here are several common analysis techniques that are used in NLP. Each of these techniques can be powered by a number of different algorithms to get the desired level of understanding depending on the specific task and the complexity of the analysis.

            Sentiment analysis: Involves determining whether a piece of text (such as a sentence, a social media post, a review, or a tweet) expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. A sentiment is a feeling or an attitude toward something. For example, sentiment analysis can determine if this customer review of a service is positive or negative: "I had to wait a very long time for my haircut.” Sentiment helps identify and classify emotions or opinions in text to help businesses understand how people feel about their products, services, or experiences.

            A happy-looking woman with a speech bubble that says, “This is my favorite pizza, ever!” and a grumpy-looking man with a speech bubble that says, “I’m still waiting for my haircut.”

            Intent analysis: Intent helps us understand what someone wants or means based on what they say or write. It’s like deciphering the purpose or intention behind their words. For example, if someone types, “I can’t log in to my account,” into a customer support chatbot, intent analysis would recognize that the person’s intent is to get help to access their account. The chatbot might reply with details about resetting a password or other means the user can try to access their account. Virtual assistants, customer support systems, or chatbots often use intent analysis to understand user requests and provide appropriate responses or actions.

            Context (discourse) analysis: Natural language relies heavily on context. The interpretation of a statement might change based on the situation, the details provided, and any shared understanding that exists between the people communicating. Context analysis involves understanding this surrounding information to make sense of a piece of text. For example, if someone says, “They had a ball,” context analysis can determine if they are talking about a fancy dance party, a piece of sports equipment, or a whole lot of fun. It does this by considering the previous conversation or the topic being discussed. Context analysis helps NLP systems interpret words more accurately by taking into account the broader context, the relationships between words, and other relevant information.

            These three analysis techniques–sentiment analysis, intent analysis, and context analysis–play important roles in extracting valuable insights from text and speech data. They create a more sophisticated and accurate understanding and engagement with textual content in various applications of NLP.
            Summary

            In this module, you’ve learned about NLP at a very high level, and as it relates to the English language. To-date, the majority of NLP study is conducted using English, but you can also find a great deal of research done in Spanish, French, Farsi, Urdu, Chinese, and Arabic. NLP is a very rapidly evolving field of AI. And advancements in NLP are quickly leading to more sophisticated language understanding, cross-language capabilities, and integration with other AI fields.

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Understand what machine learning can do for your CRM data.
                Identify ways to use machine learning predictions.

            Unlock the Power of Your Data 

            Today, trillions of gigabytes of data exist. And as a company in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), the data you possess can predict future outcomes and drive decision-making. But according to the Salesforce Untapped Data Research, most companies aren’t harnessing the power of their data’s potential even though four out of five (80%) business leaders say data is critical to decision-making. 

            Using a type of AI called machine learning (ML), you can transform historical data into predictive insights. This is known as predictive AI, which is different from generative AI. 

                Predictive AI informs, using existing data to discover something new about the data. For example, predictive AI estimates the likelihood of attrition or fraud.
                Generative AI assists, using existing data to create new data similar to what already exists. For example, generative AI creates new text and images.

            To learn more about predictive vs generative AI, check out the Discover AI Techniques and Applications unit in Data Fundamentals for AI. 
            Inject Machine Learning into Your Business

            Predictive insights from machine learning enable business users to make better decisions, faster. Use predictive AI from machine learning to drive innovation, efficiency, and strategic decision-making across your organization.

            Benefit from Machine Learning, No Data Science Experience Required

            You don’t need to be a data scientist to leverage machine learning. While data scientists are often involved in training and refining ML models, the insights from the model are meant for the business users. According to the Harvard Business Review, data scientists struggle to communicate the value of ML insights and cite “results not used by decision makers” as one of the top challenges. 

            Adding ML to Salesforce bridges the gap between data scientists and the business. In Salesforce, users can make decisions and take actions on the ML insights, without having to read a data science report.

            You can transform historical data into meaningful insights for your organization using Einstein.

                Einstein Studio: Use the ML-powered insights in Data Cloud with Connected Models data science teams already built by connecting to it and bringing the model’s insights into Salesforce. You can leave the model where it is (like AWS SageMaker), and leverage its ML-powered insights within Salesforce.
                Einstein Discovery: Build your own ML model from the ground up in CRM Analytics, with Einstein’s guidance. Rely on Einstein to walk you through building, training, evaluating, and activating an ML model in Data Cloud.

            Now you understand what machine learning can do for your data, and can identify ways your organization can benefit from ML-powered predictions.

            Online and Offline, Sales and Marketing, Connecting the Dots

            With customer touch points occurring across so many sources, it can be hard for marketing and sales teams to create a complete, accurate view of the customer story. It’s even harder when a large portion of the sales process occurs offline. Like chapters in a book, you need to have them all together for everything to make sense. 

            When you have a complete view of the customer, you can understand how effective your marketing has been in delivering sales. You can improve the performance of your digital marketing by optimizing your bids or by focusing on the most valuable audiences. Sales teams can get even more targeted and relevant support to help them progress and close deals.

            The sales funnel has a combination of online interactions, such as site browsing, and offline interactions, such as marketing and sales qualification.
            What is Google Marketing Platform and what is Analytics 360?

            Google Marketing Platform is a unified advertising and analytics platform that helps enterprise marketers make better decisions faster. With Google Marketing Platform, you’re in control of your marketing, so you have the flexibility to adapt to the needs of your business and your customers. 

            Google Analytics 360*, part of Google Marketing Platform, gives you the tools you need to better understand your customers. Use the insights you learn to take action, such as improving your website, creating tailored audience lists, and more. In addition to the features available in Google Analytics, Analytics 360 provides additional capabilities:

                Advanced Analysis
                Unsampled reports
                Google BigQuery export
                Data-driven attribution
                Native integrations with Google Marketing Platform
                Integrations with Salesforce

            *There is an annual license fee for Analytics 360 and Salesforce is an authorized reseller.
            How Salesforce and Google Put It All Together

            With the Sales Cloud and Google Analytics 360 integration, you can link your accounts and import your Sales Cloud data directly into Analytics 360 and get a more complete view of the entire customer story, whether it happens online, offline, or both. This will help you better optimize your digital marketing and bring more customers to your sales teams.

            This integration is designed to save time, get more valuable insights, help you optimize your media, and customize your marketing experiences for specific audiences. 

            Save Time. Combining all of these offline and online insights used to be a time-consuming process involving multiple spreadsheets and disparate data. This integration helps you cut down on the wait time from importing offline conversion data and helps you stitch together these insights automatically, updating as often as hourly.

            Get More Insights. With Sales Cloud data in Analytics 360, you can see offline sales data alongside your site analytics and media data. For example, is organic search driving more phone sales compared to paid search? With your offline sales data from Salesforce Sales Cloud in Analytics 360, you now have the insights to help you answer this question, and many more.

            Optimized Media for Better ROI. Optimize paid media based on offline sales activity. For example, once you’ve created Goals in Analytics 360 based on your Sales Cloud events, you can automatically optimize your search or display campaigns for actual sales that occur offline, instead of optimizing for form submissions on your site. This will likely lead to improved ROI as you spend your digital media budgets on more valuable outcomes.

            Intelligently Build Audiences. With Sales Cloud data in Analytics 360, you will be able to more intelligently build audiences based on the intersection of online and offline data. For instance, you can create audiences in Analytics 360 made up of qualified leads from Sales Cloud. You can then reach those customers with more relevant ads, including search ads, display ads, and video ads.

            There are two key requirements you should keep in mind if you are interested in using this integration.

                You must be a licensee of both Salesforce Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 in order to use this integration. This integration is only available to customers who have purchased Analytics 360.
                The integration supports sharing data from Sales Cloud Objects Leads and Opportunities. The Leads and Opportunities shared with Analytics 360 must have originated from an Analytics 360-tagged site for the integration to work, and the lead can be created either via an online lead form (native integration) or via a phone call (custom solution adding a call tracking solution).

            Note

            If your organization uses Custom Objects, you may have to use an alternative setup depending on how those Custom Objects are deployed. Please refer to Unit 3: Dive Into Some Use Cases and Examples and corresponding resources, or consult with your service provider for more details.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Identify the key roles involved in integrating Sales Cloud and Analytics 360.
                List the technical and administrative steps needed to complete the integration.

            In this unit, we review the technical steps required to integrate Sales Cloud and Analytics 360. The good news is that linking your Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 accounts is easy!
            What’s Required?

            You will need login and administrative access to both Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud, as you’ll need to both configure Sales Cloud to collect certain data and then Analytics 360 to map to and receive that data.

            Three people standing in a meeting room discussing integration.
            Key Roles

            While stakeholders may vary depending on company size and organization, there are typically 3 key roles needed to ensure a successful integration of Sales Cloud and Analytics 360:

                Analytics Lead and/or Admin. An Analytics 360 Administrator is necessary to create a new data import from Sales Cloud and set up the new events within Analytics 360. This requires proper credentials within Analytics 360.
                CRM Lead and/or Admin. A Salesforce Administrator will need to set up the link with Analytics 360 and create the fields in Sales Cloud to store key data—Analytics Client ID (GACLID) and Google Analytics Tracking ID—in the Lead and Opportunity objects.
                Web Development Lead. A web developer is necessary to modify the lead collection form on your website and add the GACLID to the parameters passed to Sales Cloud upon lead submission.

            The size and complexity of your implementation will influence who is on the integration team. How your company is organized will also influence who is on the integration team. When you are organizing your team and considering who your stakeholders are, keep in mind, one of the main goals is to allow the marketing team and the sales team to work better together.
            Permissions

            The user performing the linking must be an Admin (have Edit permissions) for the Analytics 360 implementation. The Analytics 360 Sales Cloud Data Import requires access to several Salesforce fields, organized by object. A Sales Cloud user with System Administrator access likely has access to all necessary fields.
            Create Custom Fields in Sales Cloud

            Create three new custom fields where you will store the Google Analytics IDs in Sales Cloud. You can name these fields however you’d like. The names below provide examples. Once created, you select and map these fields at the Data Import configuration setup stage.

                Client ID: one with the Field Name, e.g., GACLIENTID
                User ID: (optional) another with the Field Name, e.g., GAUSERID
                Tracking ID: another one with the Field Name, e.g., GATRACKID 

            These custom fields need to be created on both Lead and Opportunity objects and mapped between the 2 objects so that once a lead is converted into an opportunity, these fields are copied over. Also, you should ensure that status and stages have history tracking on.
            Adjust Your Lead Form

            Adjust your lead form to pass the required information into Sales Cloud. 

                Add ClientID as well as User ID (optional) into your lead form as new hidden input field(s).
                Add Tracking ID in your lead form as a new hidden input field with the value matching the Tracking ID for your site.

            Link Analytics 360 to Your Sales Cloud Account

            In this step, you'll link Analytics to your Salesforce Sales Cloud account by creating a new Data Import data set, and then by authorizing access to your Sales Cloud account.

                First, log in to your Google Analytics 360 account and navigate to Admin > Property, then click Data Import to Create a new Data Import Schema.
                Select the Salesforce type under CRM Data to import data about offline conversions from Sales Cloud.
                Name and save your Data Set. For example, Salesforce Offline Conversions.
                Create a new Sales Cloud authorization by naming the Credentials set to reuse later (for example, GA-SC) and click Access Salesforce.com to log in to your Sales Cloud account in the pop-up and complete the linking. The pop-up will automatically close upon successful login authentication and the linking will be completed.

            The Create Data Set screen with CRM Data section and the Continue button highlighted by a red box.
            Select the Milestones to Import

            In this step, you'll select the Salesforce lead and opportunity milestones to import. You'll also choose how often to import them.

                Select the Lead and/or Opportunity milestone(s) that you want to import as Events from your Sales Cloud account to Analytics 360. For example:
                    Lead: Contacted
                    Lead: Qualified
                    Opportunity: Open / Proposal
                    Opportunity: Closed / Won
                    Opportunity: Closed / Lost
                You also have the option to import attribute and product data. Attribute data import allows you to import user attributes from custom fields and selected standard fields from your Salesforce Lead and Opportunity objects. This includes:
                    Industry
                    NumberOfEmployees
                    Rating
                    ScoreIntelligenceId

            This step is highly recommended, as these attributes enable a wide variety of new audience targeting and analysis use cases.
            Set Import Frequency and Verify Setup

            You’re almost there! In this final step, you’ll first have the opportunity to define the frequency of data import—hourly is recommended. 

                In the Analytics 360 UI, navigate to Admin > Property > Data Import and click Manage Uploads.
                In the Uploads for Salesforce Offline Conversions page, click More, then Fetch Now. This will attempt to upload your Sales Cloud data to Analytics. If the upload is successful, the Status column will show Completed. If an error occurs, the Status column shows Failed with a link to display more details.

            Dive Into Some Use Cases and Examples
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe several use cases for the Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 integration.
                Understand how data from Sales Cloud and Google Marketing Platform in Google Cloud can be used for advanced marketers.

            Now that you’ve learned the basics about the Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 integration, let’s dive deeper into use cases and examples of how our platforms can work together to empower your sales and marketing teams to work better together.
            Visualize the Full Sales Funnel from Online to Offline

            Use Online Events from Analytics 360 and Offline Events Imported from Sales Cloud 

            One of the simplest but most effective ways to get value from this integration is to explore your offline Sales Cloud data directly in Analytics 360.

                First, ensure that you are tracking the relevant steps of the online funnel with events. For example, if you want to look at the funnel of users who visited your product page then submitted a lead and finally converted, you should set up an event in Analytics 360 for when a user visits your product page.
                From there, create a custom report that looks at each of those events, the online events measured by Analytics 360 (e.g., the product page visit and the lead form submission) and the offline events imported from Sales Cloud (e.g., lead and opportunity milestones). Then analyze your full online to offline funnel to understand the performance of your different marketing channels.

            Use Custom Funnels and Build Targeted Audiences

            Using the Custom Funnels feature in Analytics 360, you can visualize the steps your users are taking to complete a purchase on your website and take action where there is drop off. Now with your Sales Cloud data integrated into Analytics 360, you can use Custom Funnels to see how successful your business is at turning online leads measured in Analytics 360 into offline sales measured in Sales Cloud.

            Imagine you are a solar panel company, and your website has a lead form potential customers can use to get in touch with a member of your sales team. Now, you can use Custom Funnels to visualize what percentage of leads submitted online were converted to in-person consult, and then which of those went on to purchase the solar panels. These visual reports help you identify drop-off points so that you can fine-tune the customer experience and improve marketing performance.

            The Solar Panel Sales Performance dashboard in Google Analytics 360 showing 101 qualified sales opportunities and a call to action based on the data.

                To take immediate action from Custom Funnels, you can simply click Create new segment to build an audience of people who have dropped off from a particular stage. Once you have that audience segment built, you can use it for media targeting, site personalization, or qualitative research. For example, you could build a segment of customers who have filled out the online lead form but have not scheduled a call with a sales agent. You could use digital ads or custom site messaging to encourage this group to follow up. You learn more about this in the sections below.
                Then, with advanced attribution tools in Analytics 360, such as Data-driven Attribution, you can create more accurate cross-channel attribution models so you can better understand what channels drive offline sales. For example, after you apply a data-driven statistical model, you may uncover that paid search and email drives more offline solar panel installations than social. You can use this information to adjust your investment for paid search and email—improving your return on ad spend (ROAS) in the process.

            Optimize Your Marketing Investment to Offline Goals

            Going one step further, you can also create Goals in Analytics 360 based on your Sales Cloud events and optimize your digital marketing campaigns for sales that occur offline, instead of just optimizing for form submissions on your site. 

            How? Simply share these goals (triggered by offline events imported from Sales Cloud) to Google Ads and Search Ads 360, then adapt your search bidding strategy to account for these goals.

            Note

            For the solar company optimizing media for installations scheduled over the phone, this could mean paying more for keywords that drive those successful phone calls, and paying less for keywords which drive unqualified leads that do not convert to consultations or to eventual sales.
            Intelligently Build Audiences with Sales Cloud Data

            In addition to more insightful reporting and smarter media optimization from offline data, the connection between Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud gives you even more audience attributes to work with, helping you improve the specificity of your audiences.

            For example, if you’re an insurance company that generates leads online but sells policies in person via an agent, you could build an audience in Analytics 360 of all customers who have purchased an auto insurance policy offline. You could use that audience to either deliver relevant display ads (like new insurance products shown to those who browsed that page online) using Display & Video 360, or customize your website (like a customer service showcase) using Optimize 360.

            Note

            Optimize 360, part of Google Marketing Platform, allows you to create different variations of your website and deliver a personalized experience that works for each customer. Powered by the native integration with Analytics 360, you can use Optimize 360 to conduct site testing and personalization on the insights you’ve gained from the Analytics 360 and Sales Cloud integration.

            Einstein lead score card indicating a positive score of 96.

            You can even use Einstein Lead Scoring to build these audiences in the above use cases. For example, the solar company could build an Analytics 360 audience of users who filled out a lead form online and then were assigned an Einstein Lead Score of 80 or higher. Then, they can share that audience with Optimize 360 to ensure those qualified users have a unique site experience or to Display & Video 360 to deliver more relevant ads to keep them engaged.
            Learn How You Can Delight Your Customers Even More

            Once you have built valuable audiences using Sales Cloud and Analytics 360, there are even more opportunities to learn about them and help you discover new, similar customers.

                Similar Audiences. Similar Audiences is a powerful—but simple—way to reach a much larger audience and drive sales by algorithmically expanding the reach of your existing audiences. For example, you can import into Analytics 360 an audience of highly qualified leads from Sales Cloud, then send that list to Display & Video 360 to build a similar audience that looks like your prospects. You can show tailored ads to this list to try to grow new business.
                Surveys. Google Surveys 360 gives you the ability to ask questions directly to your audiences, allowing you to learn more qualitative information from your users after you’ve engaged with them. For instance, you could ask your customers how they feel about your brand or your category, helping you to learn valuable and first-hand insights.
                Google Cloud for deeper analysis. The integration between Sales Cloud and Analytics 360 also allows users to take advantage of Google Cloud. All your Analytics 360 data, including your imported Sales Cloud data, can be sent directly to Google Cloud’s BigQuery—a fast, highly scalable, cost-effective, and fully managed cloud data warehouse for analytics, with built-in machine learning. Learn more.

            As you can see, by using the full capabilities of Salesforce Sales Cloud, Analytics 360 and Google Marketing Platform, you can deliver exceptional experiences for your customers and grow your business.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List the steps for creating a career plan.
                Identify your unique strengths, skills, and talents and what’s important to you.
                Describe the different elements of self-assessment. 

            A Quick Introduction to Career Development

            Whether you’re just starting out in your career or already have a few years of experience under your belt, it can be helpful to step back and think about your career plan. Career planning is not a one-time event; it’s an ongoing process to revisit throughout your career as your priorities and interests shift and change.

            Career development is like a jungle gym.

            Picture career development as a jungle gym to explore, not a ladder to climb. There are various directions you can explore: up, down, and sideways. When you’re clear about your career goals, you can choose the options that are the best fit. Then it’s time to get ready for new experiences or new roles.

            The career development process can be helpful to revisit when you’re thinking about switching careers or applying your existing experience to work in a new field. Or maybe you’re returning to work after a period out of the workforce.
            Developing a career plan involves three main steps or phases.

            Discover. Plan. Act.

            You can use these three simple steps to plan your career.

                Discover. Get to know yourself, including your motivations, experiences you want, skills to build, and career goals to achieve. Research and explore opportunities and career paths that interest you and that may not have considered before.
                Plan. Identify a goal and any skills you need to build or to reach that goal. Lay out a plan of how you will achieve that goal.
                Act.Take action on your plan. Identify how to get connected to employers and mentors that can help you. Prepare your resume and social media presence to land that dream job. 

            Get to Know Yourself

            The first step in managing your career is to get a clear picture of who you are and what you want.

            This includes:

                Knowing what motivates you and what matters in your life
                Identifying your strengths and opportunities to improve
                Finding out what you’re most interested in 

            What we want can change over time—our priorities change, we can discover new interests or skills that we want to develop and learn. This is an opportunity to check in and see where you are today.

            I know myself and what I want.

            There are many free self-assessment tools out there to help you identify your own values, skills, and interests. We’ve provided links to a few of them in the resources section. You may want to start by exploring some of these tools.

            We’ve also provided a Career Exploration Resources pack with worksheets to guide you through each step of the career development process. We recommend downloading it and finding a quiet place where you can work through it.
            What Motivates You

            Think about that day you left work or school thinking “Wow, that was a great day!”

            Do you remember what was happening? Whatever it was, you were probably doing something that you found motivating and energizing.

            Get to know what motivates you.

            What you find motivating is unique to you and it’s the starting point in getting to know yourself.

            Examples of motivators include:

                Creativity and innovation
                Problem-solving
                Being an expert 

            Curious about what motivates you? Complete the Values and Skills Assessment worksheet in the Career Exploration Resources pack you downloaded to identify your top 5.
            Next Steps

            Once you’ve completed your self-assessment, review your results and identify any themes that emerge. It can be helpful to talk over your results with a friend or family member.

            Next we explore career options and see how they align with the themes you’ve identified.

            Explore Career Options
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe the different job roles within the Salesforce ecosystem.
                Research potential career options that align to your interests.
                Identify skills and requirements for your target career goal. 

            Researching Career Pathways

            Now that you’ve looked inward to assess your current skills, interests, and values, it’s time to expand your view outward and explore different pathways that interest you.

            Perhaps you already have some ideas about roles that interest you. Perhaps you’ve thought about consulting, but aren’t sure what a day in the life is like for that role. Or perhaps there’s a specific industry that interests you, like healthcare or finance, but you’re not sure what the different roles are within that industry. Whatever your starting point, this is an opportunity to cast a wide net to see what options interest you.

            Here are a few ways to research different career pathways.

                Search job descriptions with keywords related to your interest.
                Talk to others who are already in roles you’re interested in.
                Attend industry events and meetups.
                Take people in your network out for coffee or lunch to learn more about other functions, teams, and roles.
                Shadow someone doing what you’d like to do in the future.
                Look for opportunities to be part of a special project to learn new skills. 

            Labor Market Trends

            One thing to consider as you research career options is the labor market demand for specific skills and roles. What are the jobs and industries experiencing the highest growth, and where are there more opportunities?

            Salesforce roles span multiple functional areas, including sales, IT, marketing, business management, and operations. As businesses embrace the future of mobile, big data, IoT, and AI, Salesforce skills are becoming some of the hottest skills to have on your resume, and that demand is growing.

            Knowing where the demand for a specific skill set, such as Salesforce skills, is strong can give you a starting point for researching different career options that draw upon those skills.

            Here are some places to look for labor market information.

                Occupational Outlook Handbook
                Glassdoor’s 50 Best Jobs List 

            A Day in the Life

            Another factor to consider during your research is the day-to-day activities of different roles. Does the role require more time working with others or working alone? Is the workday structured with lots of meetings or more self-directed? What types of problems does the role solve?

            Once you’ve identified specific roles that interest you, search online to find more information about a typical day for that role. Use LinkedIn or X to find people in your network with that role and ask to interview them.

            For Salesforce career pathways, you can read stories from Trailblazers who have built their careers on Salesforce. Or explore a typical day in the life of different career paths on the Salesforce Career Paths site.
            Conducting Your Research

            We’ve provided some information on different career pathways within the Salesforce ecosystem as a starting point for researching career options that interest you. Read through the career profiles, the skills required, what a day in the life of each of these jobs is like, and some of the additional resources provided. You can also expand your exploration outside this list and do your own research on job roles that interest you.

            Once you’ve identified one or two roles that look interesting, complete the career exploration worksheet in the Career Exploration Resources packet you downloaded to do a deeper dive on those career options.
            Salesforce Developer Overview

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Prepare for interviewing by creating your elevator pitch.
                Create your Salesforce resume and profile.
                Connect with employers. 

            Now You're Ready!

            Now that you know where you’re headed and you’ve created your plan to get there, it’s time to go out and land that next role. We’ve created a job seeker checklist, included in the Resources pack you downloaded, to help you make sure your personal presence is amazing both in person and online.

            You’re ready!
            Update Your Resume

            If you haven’t updated your resume in a while, it’s time to dust it off and add in your most recent work experience, and any new skills and certifications you’ve earned.

            If you’re making a major career change or changing industries, consider hiring a professional to help you position your previous experience that is relevant for the new role.

            Make sure you proofread your resume carefully. Have a friend or family member read it over if you can. You don’t want to miss out on an opportunity because you missed a typo.

            Here are a few additional tips for creating a rock star resume.

            	

            DO THIS
            	

            NOT THIS

            Use action verbs
            	

            Trained 500 users on new sales processes.
            	

            Responsible for end-user training.

            Highlight accomplishments
            	

            Designed an automated lead qualification process using Salesforce that resulted in XYZ.
            	

            Automated processes using Salesforce.

            Be accurate
            	

            Include dates for each position you’ve held.
            	

            Don’t leave off information.

            Don’t lie or provide incorrect information.
            Create Your Elevator Pitch

            An elevator pitch is the 30-second story of who you are and where you want to go, and it usually ends with a specific ask or request. It’s your personal “commercial.” Hone and practice it until you can deliver it smoothly.

            Your elevator pitch is the perfect response to questions like, “Tell me about yourself” or “What do you do?” It can prepare you for that chance encounter with the company CEO in the elevator (or in the line at the coffee shop, or anywhere!).

            You can have slightly different versions of your pitch, depending on who you’re talking to, but the basic structure is the same.

            Elements to include
            	

            Examples

            Who are you? What is your goal?
            	

                I’m an experienced Salesforce administrator looking to move into a consulting role...
                I’m a recent MBA graduate looking for a role at a nonprofit... 

            Why are you pursuing this goal? What is your motivation?
            	

                I love helping teams optimize their use of Salesforce and tackling new challenges.
                I’ve been an avid hiker and camper since I was a kid, and I want to work for an organization that’s environmentally focused. 

            What are the skills and strengths you bring? What is your key differentiator?
            	

                I have 5 years’ experience as a Salesforce administrator, and I am a self-taught developer. I’ve earned 85 Trailhead badges and multiple certifications.
                I’ve successfully implemented Salesforce for a nonprofit, and I’m an expert with the Nonprofit Success Pack. 

            What is your ask? What are the next steps?
            	

                Can I get your business card to follow up and ask you a few questions?
                Do you have any recommendations of people I can speak with?
                Are you available to grab coffee in the next couple weeks? 

            Polish Your Personal Brand

            Your social media presence is the new resume. Employers and recruiters look to social media to learn more about candidates, so it’s important to make sure your profiles are top notch and that your personal brand is epic, amazing, and every bit as professionally compelling as you are in real life.

            Consider getting a professional headshot taken to use for all your social media profiles. Or use the best recent photo you have.

            DO THIS...
            	

            NOT THAT...

            Your profile picture:

                Looks like you
                Is clear and in focus
                Is high-resolution (1400 x 425 pixels) 

            	

            Your profile picture does not:

                Include other people
                Look like you from 10 years ago
                Look out of focus or blurry 

            Salesforce Profiles

            Complete your profile on Trailhead. Make sure you have a professional photo and use your newly perfected elevator pitch for your bio.

            X

            The Salesforce community is on X, so that’s a great place to look for news and information as well as establish yourself as a thought leader.

            	

            DO THIS
            	

            NOT THAT

            X handle
            	

            Choose an X handle that represents you professionally.

                One option is to use some version of your name, like @SusanSmith.
                Or use a handle that identifies your area of expertise, like @SusanCRMpro. 

            	

            Don’t use a handle that can be considered offensive.

            Profile
            	

            Use a professional photo.

            Use your 160-character bio to describe to employers your key skills and accomplishments.

            Include a link to your LinkedIn profile or other site where employers can get more information.
            	

            Don’t write your personal memoir.

            Don’t leave it blank or empty, and don’t sell yourself short.

            Content
            	

            Tweet primarily about things that relate to your role or industry (consider setting up two accounts if you do a lot of personal tweeting).

            Follow people and companies that you’re interested in.
            	

            LinkedIn

            Show off the skills you’ve acquired on Trailhead by listing your badges and superbadges as well as any certifications.

            	

            DO THIS
            	

            NOT THAT

            Job title and headline
            	

            Use your current actual job title.

            If you are looking for work use a job title that conveys the type of role that you want to land..
            	

            Your job title shouldn’t lie. Tell it like it is. It’s a small world out there—it’s surprising how many connections you share with others. So keep it honest.

            Summary section
            	

            Include a short description of yourself and what you do currently.

            Make sure your contact information is up to date.

            Market yourself as a leader—if you speak at events or have been recognized in your industry, make sure it’s on your profile.
            	

            Don’t write your personal memoir.

            Don’t leave it blank or empty, and don’t sell yourself short.

            Don’t include anything that seems outlandish or too personal.

            Rich media
            	

            Share content 2 to 3 times a week to keep your name fresh and to establish your professional brand.

            Add key work examples to your profile where appropriate.
            	

            Don’t add things that aren’t relevant to your career and might confuse the viewer.

            Don’t overwhelm people by sharing content multiple times per day.
            Research Prospective Companies

            Another important step in creating your career plan is identifying what type of company you want to work for so you can narrow your search. There are many types of companies within the Salesforce ecosystem where Salesforce skills are in demand. Here are a few examples.

                Salesforce customers: Salesforce customers span industries and include both large enterprise companies and small and medium-sized businesses. Check out our customer success stories for examples.
                Implementation partners: Our partners, also called system integrators, have deep technology and industry expertise and help get Salesforce up and running. They include international firms, and local and industry-specific partners who can give you a tailor-made implementation.
                AppExchange partners: These are companies that have built applications on the Force.com platform and sell them on AppExchange.
                Nonprofits: There are over 20,000 Salesforce nonprofit customers. See Salesforce.org success stories for examples. 

            Here are some questions to ask yourself in narrowing your search.

                Do you prefer working for a small company or a large enterprise?
                Do you prefer a startup or a more established organization?
                What type of company culture do you prefer?
                Do you want to work for a nonprofit or mission-driven organization or a commercial enterprise?
                What industry are you most interested in? 

            Search for Salesforce Opportunities

            Ready to start your search? In addition to the general job sites such as dice.com, monster.com, and others, there are many specific job boards for Salesforce roles. Here are a few of the job boards.

                AppExchange Jobs Marketplace: Search for jobs by location or title, or post your profile for employers to find.
                Jobs at Salesforce: Work at the company voted “most innovative company in the world” for the past 5 years by Forbes magazine.
                Trailblazer Community: There are various groups dedicated to job search and job postings such as the Jobs Postings group. 

            Connect with a Recruiter

            Connect with recruiters that specialize in finding candidates for Salesforce roles. Here are just a few of the recruiters that specialize in recruiting talent with Salesforce skills.

                Mason Frank International
                Hire On-Demand
                Tech2 Resources 

            Apply for a Job

            Once you’ve identified an opportunity that you want to apply for, search on LinkedIn. See if there’s anyone in your network who works at that company and can provide more information or a recommendation or introduction.

            Review the company’s website and social media to learn more about the company’s business, culture, and products or services.

            Create a cover letter tailored to that job posting. Make sure you address how you fulfill the specific skills and competencies the employer is looking for, using the language they’ve used. Update your resume as needed to better target your experience to the posting.

            Feel free to use the job seeker checklist included in the Career Exploration Resource pack you downloaded.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain the purpose of a workforce development program.
                Describe the Workforce Navigators program.
                Identify the benefits of the Workforce Navigators program.

            What Are Workforce Development Programs?

            In simple terms, workforce development programs are a set of solutions that support job seekers in advancing their skill sets to meet current and future employment needs.

            Recent Mckinsey studies indicate that taking a skills-based approach to building the future workforce is key. Employers and employees alike benefit from programs where job seekers gain new skills for better opportunities and increase the talent pipeline to meet future demands. 

            Programs vary. They can include anything from specialized training to address a specific need for a company, to content with basic interview tips to help individuals succeed with their job search. Today, organizations across private industries, non-government, local agencies, and more offer workforce development programs. 

            At Salesforce, we provide workforce development through a set of diverse programs dedicated to training and hiring for the jobs of tomorrow. These efforts stress equality for all. Our Workforce Navigators program aims to ensure that professionals with disabilities have the same opportunities as their peers to advance their career through training, mentorship, and certification opportunities within the Salesforce ecosystem.

            Salesforce is in a unique position. We can foster our program of inclusion across partner organizations and customers and expand the reach and networks for job seekers with disabilities.

             
            Committed to Equality and Inclusion

            At Salesforce, equality is one of our core company values. And we believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity to learn and grow. 

            Everyone has a different path to career success, and we’re committed to empowering people with disabilities to find their success in the Salesforce ecosystem and to providing support on their journey. The Workforce Navigators program is an external-facing workforce development program within the Office of Accessibility at Salesforce.  

            Established in 2020 and designed for job seekers with disabilities, Workforce Navigators supports individuals who want to learn more about Salesforce through learning opportunities, mentorship, and certification access. 

            Since its inception, Workforce Navigators has helped many job seekers with disabilities along their journey. Through the program, we’ve partnered with multiple companies to help them develop a more inclusive and accessible career path for candidates with disabilities seeking employment.

            Whether you’re a job candidate with a disability or an HR practitioner working in the DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) space, inside or outside the Salesforce ecosystem, we want to help. We partner with companies to help them upskill their employees and offer the public free digital training, publishing resources, and more. Commitment to Workforce Development 

            “We can and should do more. My dream would be a call to action for business leaders, to show that business can be a great platform for change. Business and government together can create world-class educational and apprenticeship programs to invest in the future of our workforce.”  —Marc Benioff, CEO, Salesforce
            Inclusive by Design: Purpose-Filled Solutions

            You just learned that workforce development programs aim to help people develop new skills, and as a result create a well-trained workforce that can meet the growing demands of jobs in the future. Workforce Navigators takes this a step further by supporting Trailblazers with disabilities throughout their entire journey, ensuring accessible experiences every step of the way.

            We believe that a robust and actionable workforce development program that supports professionals with disabilities includes the following elements.

                A referral stream for professionals with disabilities seeking career advancement opportunities.
                Accessible training and learning materials universally designed for inclusion.
                Opportunities for paid work experience to build an individual’s resume.

            By supporting professionals with disabilities through talent development, everyone can perform at their peak. We offer a network and structure to support growth through an entire career.

             
            Workforce Navigators Benefits

            Workforce Navigators offers myriad benefits–from accessible learning content to certification and scholarship support. As a job seeker, you can take advantage of learning content presented in the way that best works for you. And if financial support is a concern, you can apply for a scholarship to assist with your learning journey.

            For DEI practitioners or hiring managers, you have the opportunity to review programs that can be reapplied within your organization. And importantly, you can tap into a wealth of diverse talent to meet growing job demands. 

             
            Workforce Navigators in Action

            Molly just started a new job at a finance firm that operates on the Salesforce platform. She uses screen magnification in combination with a screen reader to enlarge content on the screen and also have it spoken aloud. She sometimes has trouble using the mouse; she is much faster using the keyboard to get work done. This is her first time using Salesforce, and she is searching for a community where she can pick up tips and tricks while she works her way through Trailhead.

            Molly has the opportunity to join Workforce Navigators for training, mentorship, and scholarships. She can also tap into the Workforce Navigators written accessibility resources like screen reader instructions and keyboard-only use.

            In the next unit, we take a closer look at the three key components of Workforce Navigators.

            A Three-Tiered Approach to Support

            As you learned in the previous unit, Workforce Navigators is a workforce development program designed to support professionals with disabilities through mentorship, training, and scholarships. We take a multipronged approach to supporting job seekers with disabilities and training. There are many benefits of Workforce Navigators. Let’s explore!

            Training

            When you join Workforce Navigators, Salesforce learning opportunities expand and open up to you, beginning with our rigorous and disciplined training. As part of Workforce Navigators, we offer both intensive, virtual bootcamps and self-paced, online curriculums. 

            Trailhead Virtual Bootcamp is a multi-week program that provides fundamental knowledge and expert-led guidance for building Salesforce skills quickly. Job seekers can join prescriptive bootcamps and learn directly from Salesforce experts through live sessions. Professionals looking to advance their career can find new opportunities and develop skills and prove their expertise by completing Trailhead badges or earning Salesforce certifications through the Bootcamp.

            To meet individual needs and schedules, job seekers can also get the same hands-on learning at their own pace. This flexible, self-paced option offers access to the Salesforce organization to practice new skills, test knowledge, and review learning resources.

            Scholarship Programs

            To help provide access to training for individuals who may need financial assistance, each year we award Trailhead Virtual Bootcamp scholarships to skilled professionals with disabilities who meet certain requirements.

            At Salesforce, we take great pride in helping pave the way to a more inclusive workforce. We recognize that fostering a more diverse and inclusive culture is a journey. Building community through individual outreach and in partnership with other companies and organizations is a key part of this journey. And it begins with individuals in the community who can help build and make connections with Workforce Navigators.

            We work with workforce development organizations to train, certify, and place people with disabilities in the Salesforce ecosystem. For example, we have partnerships with nonprofits like the Blind Institute of Technology and BOSMA. The Blind Institute of Technology is a nationwide organization whose aim is to reduce the unemployment rate within the blind and visually impaired community. BOSMA is an organization that partners with businesses to create jobs and training programs for people who are blind. 

            So what does “work with workforce development organizations” really mean? Let’s take a look.

            Akasia Parran has been legally blind for 5 years. The unmet need in her job search was accessible technology. As part of our partnership with the Blind Institute of Technology, Akasia had the opportunity to take a course that offers professionals with disabilities the chance to gain skills for meaningful employment. 

            The Salesforce free online learning modules offer enhanced accessibility features. For Akasia, that meant that she was able to complete coursework and became a certified Salesforce Administrator in just 6 months.

            “I wouldn’t have a career without Salesforce’s continuing efforts to create accessible software.” —Akasia Parran

            To learn more about Akasia’s story, read Breaking Accessibility Barriers and Becoming a Salesforce Pro.

            As a collective whole, we know we can accomplish far more together than we ever could alone. The support we receive from our nonprofit partners helps us provide accessible accommodations across our entire Salesforce ecosystem. If you’re a professional with a disability pursuing Salesforce credentials, we want you to have the support you need to successfully complete the certification exams. 

            To request an accommodation, follow the steps in this article. Be sure to work with your doctor ahead of time to identify what accommodations you need before submitting your request.

            Remove Barriers: Pave the Way for a More Inclusive Hiring Experience

            Earlier in this unit, we mentioned that achieving inclusion and accessibility is a journey. It’s important to recognize that every company is at a different stage of development for inclusion. As a Trailblazer with a disability or an advocate for inclusion, we can all play a positive role in helping to improve the landscape. 

            Any one of us can be a change agent when we encounter a barrier to success. While most barriers are likely an oversight and not an intentional exclusion, it’s up to us all to drive culture changes that remove barriers and put in place best practices.

            If you feel you have experienced a barrier at any point in our hiring experience, we want to hear about it. Accessibility blockers on any software platform should be reported to the company’s accessibility team. If you find an accessibility blocker on the Salesforce platform, we welcome your feedback and have a system in place for reporting. Use this article to submit your accessibility issue and create a product accessibility support case.

            It’s also important to celebrate successes and best-in-class examples of inclusion and accessibility. View our events page for information about upcoming guest lectures. If you have a great story to share about your company, contact us to see if you can become part of our series.

            Next, let’s consider a scenario where an accessibility barrier prevented a professional from performing at their fullest potential. 
            Accessibility Barrier Example

            Jack finds a great role posted online with a company that has a strong reputation for valuing diversity. Jack is a cybersecurity expert and has been deaf since birth. He applies online for the role and is asked to take a few online tests to move forward in the interview process. Excited to begin, he opens the first test and discovers there's a video he must watch and answer questions about. Unfortunately, the video does not have captions. He does poorly on the exam, and the results are not representative of his actual expertise and knowledge.

            After he completes the test, he reaches out to his hiring contact to let them know the challenges he encountered. As it turns out, they have a version with captioning, and Jack is able to retake the test and successfully continue with the hiring process as a top candidate. And going forward, the company institutes a new policy to embed captioning into all its training videos so that new hires have the option of turning on captioning, as needed.

            Guard Data Transmission
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Define transport layer security (TLS).
                Identify how public key infrastructure (PKI) secures data transmission. 

            Encrypting Data Transmission with TLS

            One critical link in securing data transmission is to use transport layer security (TLS) to encrypt it. TLS is a cryptographic protocol designed to secure communications over a computer network. A protocol describes how the cryptographic algorithms should be used to secure information. Cryptographic protocols are used to secure transferred messages during application-level data transport. They are widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP). But their use as the security layer in Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) remains the most publicly visible instance for secure web browsing.
            Using a PKI Service

            Many organizations use internal services to simplify the process of getting certificates for TLS. If your organization has such a service, you should use it for provisioning and delivering the short-lived certificates to hosts and services upon which TLS relies. If your organization does not have an internal service, you should consider planning for or adopting a public key infrastructure (PKI) service. A PKI service simplifies the process of encryption by setting up a system for acquiring the certificates that TLS uses to authenticate identity.

            Let’s start by looking at how a PKI service works. PKI is a set of roles, policies, hardware, software, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. Digital certificates establish your credentials when doing business or other transactions on the web. They are issued by a certification authority (CA) who vouches for their authenticity. 

            In cryptography, a PKI is an arrangement that binds public keys with respective identities of entities (like people and organizations). A public key is the key your web browser uses to encrypt or scramble data into ciphertext, which is sent to a website. The data is then decrypted with a private key held by the entity that is authorized to view the data. The binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a CA. A CA confirms the validity of a website's certificate and, therefore, verifies that the website itself is valid. 

            Diagram that shows how the public key encrypts data on the client side and decrypts it on the server side

            In general, PKI provides “trust services.” Trust services is the process of ensuring the electronic identification of signatories and services. Trust service objectives respect one or more of the following capabilities: confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

            Confidentiality: Ensures that no entity can maliciously or unwittingly view your data in cleartext. Data is encrypted to make it secret so that even if it is read, it appears as gibberish. This is why the most common use of PKI for confidentiality purposes is in the context of TLS.

            Integrity: Ensures that if transmitted data is tampered with in any way, there is clear evidence that it happened. This traceability is a key trust objective of PKI systems.

            Authenticity: Ensures that you have connection certainty for authentication of data in transit on both the server-side and the client-side of the transmission.

            These trust services are why organizations use PKI services to generate certificates for data encryption over TLS. A certificate service is basically an organization of services surrounding a CA that allows it to issue, renew, and revoke certificates. Certificates are what pass a public key to computers that need to communicate securely using the PKI system.

            Your organization most likely has its own customized PKI service to generate the certificates you need to securely encrypt your data in transit using TLS. You should use that system to encrypt data in transit, so that you do not risk exposing yourself and your organization to attackers on the open internet who might wish to do you harm.

            Encrypt Data at Rest
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Define the risks to data at rest.
                Explain encryption best practices to protect data at rest. 

            What Is Data at Rest?

            Data at rest is the data housed on computer data storage in any digital form, whether it's in cloud storage, file hosting services, or databases. Data at rest can even include physical data stored in warehouses, spreadsheets, archives, or tapes. For the purposes of this module, data refers to electronic data. 

            Depending on the core business of your organization, data at rest can be one of the most valuable assets you have. That’s why this type of data is subject to threats from attackers. To prevent this data from being accessed or stolen, organizations often employ security protection measures such as password protection, data encryption, or a combination of both. Let’s take a closer look at encryption of data at rest. 

            Information protected by encryption both at rest and in transit.
            Use Encryption to Secure Organization Data at Rest

            Just as it’s crucial to encrypt data in transit, it’s also important to encrypt sensitive data at rest. This is to ensure that you handle private data securely, and that it stays private. Your goal when encrypting data at rest should be to implement a solution that prevents data visibility in the event of unauthorized access or theft. 

            When protecting data at rest, you want to make sure that encrypted data remains encrypted when other controls fail. Sometimes this is done by combining network segmentation and increasing levels of encryption. Encrypting data on multiple levels is a good way to enhance its safety. 

            At a minimum, you should: 

                Implement cryptography on the database housing the data and on the physical devices where the databases are stored.
                Update data encryption keys on a regular basis.
                Store encryption keys separately from the data.
                Enable crypto-shredding at the end of the data or hardware lifecycle.
                Audit sensitive data at scheduled intervals.
                Store only the minimum amount of sensitive data. 

            While there are many ways to configure encrypted data at rest systems, here are some basic best practices.

            Asymmetric cryptography (also known as public-key encryption) uses the difficulty of certain math problems to give you a pair of keys, each of which can be used to encrypt a message so that only the other key in the pair can decrypt it. That means anyone can use the public key to hide something, and only the holders of the private key can unlock it. The holders of the private key can also “sign” any message, and anyone in the world can use the public key to verify it was really signed by them. 

            Asymmetric encryption is more secure than symmetric encryption as it uses two keys for the process. In a symmetric key system, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, while in an asymmetric system, the encryption key is public and distinct from the decryption key, which is kept secret. Asymmetric cryptography tools include authentication tokens, Docker or Java’s JCA.  

            Hardware security module (HSM) is hardware that holds private keys and it can be used without disclosing them. While it's running, you can put public-key encrypted information on one end and get decrypted information out of the other, and nobody can ever discover the private key. 

            Defense in depth means applying controls at different layers of your technology stack so that you don’t rely on just one control to protect your data. One way to implement defense in depth when it comes to encryption is to combine your encryption capabilities with asymmetric cryptography and HSM. This means that even if parts of the system are compromised, it is still difficult to access all the data. 

            Strong encryption methods include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) or Rivest–Shamir–Adleman (RSA). These are both encryption standards used by governments, technology companies, and other organizations. The difference between them is that AES is a symmetric key system, and RSA is an asymmetric key system. This means that AES uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while RSA uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt data. 
            Sum It Up

            In this module, you’ve learned more about protecting data transmission with TLS and PKI, and encrypting data at rest. Using these methods across the board minimizes the chance that attackers can access it. You can learn more about best practices in cybersecurity from real security practitioners by visiting the Cybersecurity Learning Hub on Trailhead.

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Define key management solutions (KMS).
                Explain the value of using a KMS.
                Identify KMS methodologies.
                Define key management terms.

            What Is a Key Management Solution?

            Key management solutions (KMS) rely on a set of dedicated servers to administer a full lifecycle of cryptographic keys (keys used to encrypt data) and protect them from loss or misuse. KMS and other key management technologies ultimately control the generation, usage, storage, archival, and deletion of encryption keys. Additionally, to fully protect their loss or misuse, companies must limit access to these keys, either by restricting physical access or controlling user access by creating clear and defined user roles.

            Data encryption is the bedrock of cybersecurity. Encrypted data remains worthless ciphertext (encrypted or encoded text that is unreadable by humans or computers) to anyone who doesn't have access to the encryption keys. So, key management is—in turn—the key to encrypted data security. 

            Keys unlock your secrets, which means they pose a specific security risk if accessed by an unauthorized user. Somehow, you must keep track of the keys, decide who has access to them, and figure out how they can be accessed without being exposed. This is the central task of any KMS.
            Why KMS?

            KMS is designed to provide application owners a way to generate and manage cryptographic keys. These keys should be protected and managed in a secure and physical computing device—a hardware security module (HSM)—when possible. HSMs are designed and certified to be tamper-evident and intrusion-resistant, and they provide the highest level of physical security.

            A common mistake people make when encrypting data at rest is to use an inadequate key, or to store the key along with the encrypted data. This is the equivalent of leaving a key under the doormat of your house. It’s the first place a malicious actor looks for a key, and it puts your data in serious danger. Instead, make sure that keys only exist on devices in a transient state. That is, the user should enter them only so that the data can be decrypted and then erased from memory. 

            A thief looks under the doormat of a house and finds the key.
            KMS Methodologies

            There are various KMS methodologies that centralize key generation, distribution, and management. These allow you to maintain control of what keys are in use and who is using them.

            Traditional Public-Key Solutions

            One reason keys have been difficult to manage is that in a traditional public-key solution, a key is typically assigned to an individual, server, or organization. This key works like a signature, validating that the data has come from the proper source. In this technology solution, keypairs persist for years at a time, so the key must be carefully guarded against disclosure. Anyone with access to the private key can counterfeit that person's digital signature. 

            Transient-Key Solutions

            In transient-key solutions, the keypair is assigned to a brief interval of time, not to a particular person or entity. Data signed by a specific private key becomes associated with a specific time and date. A keypair is active only for a few minutes, after which the private key is permanently destroyed. Therefore, unlike public-key solutions, transient-key solutions do not depend upon the long-term security of the private keys. A KMS works as a transient-key solution. Larger organizations use a KMS with an HSM to provide a very high level of security.
            Key Management Terms

            Let’s talk about some cryptographic key terms you might encounter when working with KMS solutions. 

            Password versus key: In Secrets Management for Developers, you learned about the difference between a password and a key. Remember that the primary difference between keys and passwords is that the latter are intended to be generated, read, remembered, and reproduced by a human user. A key, by contrast, is intended for use by the software that is implementing the cryptographic algorithm, so human readability is not required. In fact, most users will, in most cases, be unaware of the existence of the keys being used on their behalf by the security components of their everyday software applications.

            Symmetric versus asymmetric keys: Asymmetric key algorithms use separate keys for encryption and decryption, while symmetric key algorithms use a single key for both processes. Because an asymmetric algorithm uses multiple keys, the process takes longer to produce than a symmetric key algorithm does. However, the benefit is that an asymmetric algorithm is much more secure than a symmetric key algorithm.

            Cryptographic hash: This is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit array of a fixed size (the hash value, hash, or message digest). Hashing is a cryptographic process that can be used to validate the authenticity and integrity of various types of input. It is widely used in authentication systems to avoid storing plaintext passwords in databases, but is also used to validate files, documents and other types of data.

            Cryptographic salt: This is the random data used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes data, a password, or a passphrase. Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage.

            A KMS solution protects your secrets as follows: A developer uses KMS to create or store a secret using the KMS producer service. The producer generates a new secret, embeds authorization by attaching the set of services that are allowed to access it, and encrypts it. The developer receives the resulting encrypted blob to check-in to source control along with their application. The encrypted secret is deployed to production along with the application, where it is decrypted and exposed to code via an in-memory file system.

            Manage Your Keys
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Define the key management lifecycle.
                Explain the different approaches to key management solutions (KMS).

            Key Management Lifecycle

            Now that you’ve learned how to keep your production secrets safe, let’s talk about the key management lifecycle and why it’s equally important for security. While there are many phases to this lifecycle, key management focuses on creating, maintaining, securing, and controlling the use of cryptographic keys. Monitoring this process allows you to assure that the keys are properly created and deployed. There are four phases to the key management lifecycle, which are important to securing production secrets. 

                Key Creation and Activation
                Key Revocation
                Key Escrow (Backup)
                Key Deletion (Destruction)

            Let’s take a closer look at each.

            Key Creation and Activation

            A key manager creates the encryption key and stores it in a key storage database along with its attributes: name, activation date, size, and so forth. You can activate keys at creation or set them to activate later.

            Key Revocation

            Any key administrator can use the key manager to revoke a key. This places the key in an invalidated state and it can no longer be used for cryptographic purposes like encryption and decryption. If needed, you can reactivate revoked keys. An example of this may be when an old key is required to decrypt data previously encrypted with it.

            Key Escrow (Backup)

            Key escrow allows for keys to be securely archived when they deactivate. Much like key revocation, you can reactivate archived keys if required. 

            Key Deletion (Destruction)

            When a key is no longer necessary or has become compromised, an admin may choose to delete it from the storage database. This removes all or certain instances from the database, making recovery impossible (outside of any stored backups). Should a key become compromised, an admin can immediately delete it, allowing your data to remain secure.A cycle with symbols of each phase of the key management lifecycle: creation and activation, revocation, escrow, and destruction
            KMS Strategies

            An organization can take one of several different approaches when it comes to key management strategies: decentralized, distributed, or centralized.

            Manage Your Keys—Decentralized (Local)

            A decentralized key management solution (DKMS) or local key management is an approach to key management where no central authority exists. Individuals bear all the responsibility for creating, securing, managing, and destroying cryptographic keys. An example of this is local backup encryption or a local file vault on a computer.

            Manage Your Keys—Distributed (Siloed)

            Another approach is to use a distributed or siloed key management approach, where you consolidate the management for a particular application or system. A common example of this is full disk encryption that is used in large enterprise organizations. The keys for the disk encryption are all managed by a central application that is used specifically for that one purpose.

            Manage Your Keys—Centralized

            There is also the option of using a dedicated and centralized KMS (CKMS). Distributed key management solutions become increasingly difficult to manage as your company grows. A CKMS can unify key management across your entire company allowing for scale with the needs of the business. Benefits of a CKMS include providing tamper-evident records for proof of compliance along with streamlining key management processes, automatic key updates, and backup and recovery options. 

            It’s important to note that all of the above methods are available within the cloud, as well as your company’s on-premise system for key management. However, if scalability, auditing, and security are of high concern, CKMS is ideal. By managing keys in a centralized fashion, you reduce operational burdens and associated costs, while maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of your keys.

            Implement Mobile Application Security
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Identify the Open Web Application Security Project’s mobile security resources.
                List actions to address improper platform usage.
                Describe how to mitigate insecure data storage, communication, and authentication.
                Explain the risk associated with insufficient cryptography.

            Before You Start

            If you completed the Mobile Application Security module, then you already know about the mobile application (app) landscape and key skills relevant to mobile application security (appsec) engineering. Now let’s talk about how to leverage the Open Web Application Security Project’s (OWASP’s) mobile security resources to help you address mobile security risks.
            OWASP’s Mobile Security Resources

            OWASP® is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of applications (apps) and software by providing guidelines through local and global conferences and open source software projects. These include the OWASP Mobile Top 10 project, web app project, application programming interface (API) security project, serverless computing project, and much more. In this module, we use the OWASP Mobile Top 10 as a framework to explain the way to implement mobile appsec.

            As a mobile application security (appsec) engineer, your challenge is to secure an ever-growing and constantly updating mobile app portfolio with finite resources. Thankfully, you can standardize and scale mobile appsec testing using the OWASP Mobile Security Project. The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile apps. You can use the OWASP’s mobile security resources to build efficient and effective mobile appsec programs. Let’s take a quick look at some of the OWASP’s mobile security resources.

            OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard 

            The OWASP Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is a standard for mobile appsec. As a mobile appsec engineer, you can use the MASVS to develop more secure apps, and to ensure completeness and consistency of security test results. The goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation. The MASVS maps directly to the OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG). 

            OWASP Mobile Security Testing Guide

            The OWASP MSTG is a project that seeks to define the industry standard for mobile appsec. It covers the processes, techniques, and tools you can use during a mobile appsec test, and an exhaustive set of test cases that enables you to deliver consistent and complete test results. The OWASP MSTG is a comprehensive manual for mobile appsec testing and reverse engineering for iOS and Android mobile security testers.

            OWASP Mobile Top 10

            The OWASP Mobile Top 10 list is a great resource for mobile appsec engineers who want to design and secure mobile apps, because many of them are inherently vulnerable to security risks. The OWASP Mobile Top 10 is a mobile security project focused on highlighting security vulnerabilities in mobile apps and the remediation strategies to mitigate the risk associated with them. This list sheds light on technical threats and highlights the risk to the business. Note that this list only covers some of the potential vulnerabilities that can be present in a mobile application and it is not comprehensive. 

            Here are the OWASP Mobile Top 10 Risks.

                M1: Improper Platform Usage
                M2: Insecure Data Storage
                M3: Insecure Communication
                M4: Insecure Authentication
                M5: Insufficient Cryptography
                M6: Insecure Authorization
                M7: Poor Code Quality
                M8: Code Tampering
                M9: Reverse Engineering
                M10: Extraneous Functionality

            Manage Security Risks with the OWASP Mobile Top 10

            Let’s take a look at how you, as a mobile appsec engineer, can use the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to help better manage security risks in your mobile apps.

            Angeli is an Android operating system (OS) mobile appsec engineer at a multinational software corporation that develops enterprise mobile apps to manage business operations and customer relations.

            Angeli holding a mobile device with a shield and a checkmark on it

            Angeli has been tasked with using the OWASP Mobile Top 10 to evaluate her organization’s mobile apps and verify that they’re secure. Let’s follow along as she does so.

            Note

            The scenarios below describe examples of each risk but do not represent an exhaustive list of issues that could occur under each risk.

            M1: Improper Platform Usage

            This risk covers the misuse of a mobile OS feature or a failure to use platform security controls properly. It might include Android intents, platform permissions, misuse of biometric authentication mechanisms, password storage tools, or some other security control that’s part of the mobile OS.

            During the evaluation of several of her company’s Android apps, Angeli notices that many of them are storing cryptographic keys on the file system. Because cryptographic keys are commonly used to secure particularly sensitive data they are a primary target for attackers.

            An unauthorized user could use a variety of attacks to read the keys from the file system. Angeli knows that storing cryptographic material on the standard file system is against Android’s best practices and that her organization is at risk of improper platform usage. She circles back with the development team to help them implement a solution using the Android keystore system to store the cryptographic keys as securely as possible.

            M2: Insecure Data Storage

            This risk covers a case where an adversary attains a lost or stolen mobile device or executes malware or another repackaged app on the mobile device. Angeli evaluates the organization’s apps for this risk, and realizes that an app is storing usernames and credentials in plain text in system logs.

            She circles back with the application development team to see if they performed a threat model on the app prior to release, in order to identify insecure storage as a possible risk. Noticing they did not perform one, she recommends that the application development manager incorporate threat modeling into the development process so that these bugs are identified before release.

            Angeli further recommends that the development team identify sensitive data that the app processes, stores, or transmits, and validate that the data isn’t unnecessarily exposed. Lastly, Angeli informs the development team to create and implement a plan as soon as possible for remediating and redeploying the mobile app. Angeli works with the development team to perform a root cause analysis to uncover why the vulnerability was not identified before deployment.

            M3: Insecure Communication

            This risk covers a case where a threat agent might exploit vulnerabilities to intercept sensitive data while it’s traversing the mobile device’s carrier network and the internet. This can occur if an adversary compromises or monitors your local Wi-Fi network, or if there’s malware on your mobile device capturing the sensitive data in transit.

            In evaluating her organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli realizes that one of the apps fails to verify that the certificate offered is valid, and instead unconditionally accepts any certificate offered to it by the server. This destroys any mutual authentication capability between the mobile app and the endpoint, and leaves the app vulnerable to manipulator-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks through a transport layer security (TLS) proxy.

            An MITM attack occurs when a perpetrator positions themselves in a conversation between two parties, such as a user and an application. The intention is to either eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties by making it appear as if a normal exchange of information is underway and capturing sensitive data.

            To address this risk, Angeli works with the app development team to ensure the app only establishes a secure connection after verifying the identity of the endpoint server using trusted certificates in the keystore.

            M4: Insecure Authentication

            This risk covers a case where a threat agent exploits authentication vulnerabilities through attacks that use available or custom-built tools. In evaluating the organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli realizes that an app uses a weak password configuration policy to simplify how the user enters a password. She works with the application development team to replace the 4-digit personal identification number (PIN) currently allowed as an authentication credential with a stronger authentication mechanism, to make it more difficult for adversaries to deduce the password.

            M5: Insufficient Cryptography

            This risk covers a case where a threat agent has physical access to data that’s been encrypted improperly, or uses mobile malware to take advantage of insufficient encryption on a mobile device. In evaluating her organization’s mobile apps for this risk, Angeli discovers that an app uses the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, which has been shown to have significant weaknesses. She works with the application development team to re-engineer the app to instead follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines on recommended algorithms.
            Sum It Up

            Angeli’s organization is on the road to having more secure apps—but her work here isn’t done. In the next unit, find out how Angeli protects her organization’s apps against the rest of the Mobile Top 10.

            Address Mobile Application Risks
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe how to address insecure authorization.
                List actions to improve code quality.
                Explain how to mitigate code tampering.
                Identify reverse engineering risks.
                Describe how to prevent extraneous functionality risks. 

            Address Mobile Risks

            Let’s continue to follow Angeli as she works to secure her organization’s mobile apps, using the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Mobile Top 10 as a guide.

            M6: Insecure Authorization

            This risk covers a case where a threat agent exploits authorization vulnerabilities through attacks that use available or custom-built tools. It’s important to recognize the difference between authentication and authorization. Authentication is the act of identifying an individual. Authorization is the act of confirming that the identified individual has the permissions necessary to perform the act. The two are closely related, as authorization checks should always immediately follow authentication of an incoming request from a mobile device.

            Upon inspecting the organization’s applications (apps) carefully, Angeli discovers that authorization decisions are being executed locally on the client-side of the mobile app during the authentication request. This could lead to a situation where an adversary could tweak an incoming request and masquerade as a member of a group they don’t belong to, to gain access to administrative functionality.

            Angeli works with the developers to update the app to authorize the roles and permissions of authenticated users using only information contained in back-end systems. She reminds them it’s important to avoid relying on any roles or permission information that comes from the mobile device itself.

            M7: Poor Code Quality

            This risk covers the case where a threat agent passes untrusted inputs to method calls (operators used to call self-contained blocks of code that perform a specific task) made within mobile code. Threat actors typically exploit these poor code quality issues via malware or phishing scams.

            Working with the mobile app pen testing team, Angeli learns that the team has been able to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in one of the organization’s apps. The exploit allows them to write into areas known to hold executable code and replace it with malicious code. She works with the development team to reengineer the code by marking certain regions within the code as nonexecutable—a technique known as executable space protection. They also implement bounds checking to automatically check that data written to a buffer is within acceptable boundaries. Finally, Angeli works with the team to implement an automated process to identify future buffer overflows through the use of third-party static analysis tools.

            M8: Code Tampering

            This risk covers the case where the organization’s apps do not implement code signing. The lack of code signing allows an attacker to tamper with the app’s code. Typically, this attack occurs when an attacker tweaks a legitimate app’s code after downloading it from a popular app store. The attacker modifies the app to include malicious code then uploads it to a lesser known third-party app store, where an unsuspecting user downloads it.

            Angeli discovers that an attacker has created a counterfeit version of one of her organization’s apps. The counterfeit version captures and transmits the user’s personally identifiable information (PII), along with their username/password, to a third-party site. This allows the attacker to use the information for fraudulent purposes.

            Angeli contacts both app stores to inform them of the fraudulent use. She provides her app’s signature (distinctive, pattern-based detection methods which use expressions or marks for identifying app traffic), so the store can verify that her company is the legal owner of the app. They remove the unauthorized copies of the app from their stores, replacing it with the signed version. Angeli puts in place a plan to continually monitor the major app stores to check for any new unauthorized versions that have been published, and to submit new reclaiming requests on a regular basis.

            M9: Reverse Engineering

            This risk covers the case where an attacker downloads the targeted app from an app store and analyzes it within their own local environment using a suite of different tools to see how it works. The attacker uses reverse engineering to reveal sensitive and unencrypted information about back-end servers, cryptographic constants and ciphers, intellectual property, and more.

            Working with the mobile app pen testing team to evaluate one of the organization’s apps, Angeli discovers that an attacker would be able to run strings against the unencrypted app and find a hard-coded connection string that contains authentication credentials to a back-end database. An attacker could use those credentials to gain access to the database and steal PII data about the app’s users. Angeli consults with the development team on a remediation, and they decide to remove the hard-coded connection string and replace the functionality with a server side access controlled API to provide the required data to the application.

            M10: Extraneous Functionality

            This risk covers the case where an attacker seeks to understand extraneous functionalities or unnecessary components within a mobile app to discover hidden functionality in back-end systems. The attacker can typically exploit extraneous functionality directly from their own systems without any involvement by end users.

            Working with the organization's pen testing team, Angeli discovers that the mobile app developers included backdoor functionality in one of the organization’s apps that was not intended for release into production environments. An attacker could discover this functionality and use it to execute back-end administrative functions. To prevent this from happening in the future, Angeli works with her organization to implement manual, secure code reviews using subject matter experts most knowledgeable with this code.

            The subject matter experts make sure to examine the app’s configuration settings to discover any hidden switches, remove test code from the final production release, and examine all application programming interface (API) endpoints accessed by the mobile app to verify that they’re well documented and publicly available. They also examine log statements to ensure nothing overly descriptive about the back end is being written to the logs. Thanks to the OWASP Mobile Top 10, Angeli’s organization is now much more secure.

            Test Mobile Applications
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Identify the differences between static application security testing and dynamic application security testing.
                Define interactive application security testing and runtime application self-protection.

            Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing

            As mobile applications (apps) continue to grow as an attack vector, your organization should prioritize mobile application security (appsec) to fortify its overall security posture. Adversaries employ both static attacks based on source code itself and dynamic attacks that exploit app functionality. Understanding and remediating mobile app vulnerabilities in your code is vital for your mobile appsec program.

            Mobile appsec testing is the process of analyzing mobile apps to find security weaknesses, such as misconfigurations or vulnerabilities. Testing your apps regularly decreases the chance of vulnerabilities occuring or being exploited. Static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) are the most popular evaluation techniques available to you in order to secure mobile apps during the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

            Static Application Security Testing

            SAST is about the prevention of defects, whereas DAST is about finding and fixing the defects. While you perform SAST testing in the early stages of the SDLC, before deploying code into production environments, you perform DAST later in the lifecycle. Static and dynamic testing complement one another, and each type has a distinct approach to detecting bugs.

            You use SAST to analyze source code for known vulnerabilities as a form of white-box testing that scans and analyzes source code at rest from the inside out. SAST is programming-language dependent. You perform SAST to check the defects in software without actually executing the code of the mobile app. SAST tooling scans the source code looking for potentially vulnerable patterns and provides a list of results that then are triaged to weed out false positives. A false positive is a mislabeled security vulnerability indicating there is a threat when, in actuality, there isn't.

            A hand holding a mobile phone with an SAST checklist on the screen

            SAST is often referred to as verification: the evaluation of the development process. Though the most mature and easiest to deploy of the appsec testing tools, SAST scans are slow and often prone to high false-positive rates when identifying potential vulnerabilities. 

            Dynamic Application Security Testing

            DAST is a form of black-box testing you perform by executing the mobile app’s code. You use it to look for vulnerabilities by simulating external attacks on an application while it runs in a test environment. You use DAST to penetrate an application from the outside by checking its exposed interfaces for weaknesses. 

            In DAST, you work with the actual mobile app, not some artifact or model that represents the system. You provide an input, receive output, and compare the output to the expected behavior. You use test cases for testing processes and study how the code behaves during execution. DAST is often referred to as validation: the evaluation of a finished product. You do this testing as one of the last steps before deployment in a test environment, and after code deployment. As a result, fixing problems at this stage becomes more expensive because the product is actively in use.

            DAST is programming-language agnostic and is a good method for preventing regressions. However, it’s hard to automate and scale because you need experienced security professionals to tailor these test tools to specific use cases, making it more difficult to create a comprehensive testing strategy for each app. DAST also cannot pinpoint the exact source of the problem (for example, the line of code). Furthermore, it can generate a lot of false positives. 

            Examples of methodologies for dynamic testing are unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.

                Unit Testing: Testing of individual modules by developers
                Integration Testing: Testing the interface between different modules when they are joined
                System Testing: Testing performed on the system as a whole
                Acceptance Testing: Testing done from the user’s point of view

            The following table summarizes the differences between SAST and DAST.

            While both tools have their advantages and disadvantages, using them in tandem—along with interactive application security testing (IAST) and runtime application self-protection (RASP)—helps strengthen your app’s security, one testing technique at a time. Let’s take a look! 
            Interactive Application Security Testing and Runtime Application Self-Protection

            Interactive Application Security Testing

            SAST and DAST only provide a snapshot in time of a mobile app’s security weaknesses. These tools alone can’t keep up with today’s agile SDLC processes. This means that development, operations, and security teams are often one step behind as they develop, test, and transition software into production environments. To make it easier for businesses, appsec tool manufacturers realized that SAST and DAST techniques could be merged together to create better, more efficient tools that would include the advantages of both. This is how interactive application security testing (IAST) was born.

            IAST analyzes code for security vulnerabilities while the app is run by an automated test, human tester, or any activity “interacting” with the app functionality. While DAST provides an outside perspective on the app before it goes live, IAST uses software instrumentation (an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance and diagnose errors) to analyze running apps.

            IAST techniques cover more code, produce better results, and verify a broader range of security rules faster than either SAST or DAST tools working alone. IAST solutions deploy agents and sensors in running apps and continuously analyze all app interactions initiated by manual tests, automated tests, or a combination of both, to identify vulnerabilities in real time. If a vulnerability is detected, the tester or testing team is notified.

            This analysis allows developers to pinpoint the source of an identified vulnerability and fix it quickly. IAST also produces less false positives and false negatives (misidentified security vulnerabilities that claim you don’t have vulnerability when you do) than SAST and DAST, decreasing the workload on scarce security resources and making it easier to identify the most critical flaws.

            IAST tools are not confined to a particular phase of the SDLC. Even though they deliver a lot of value during the development phase, because they help developers fix risks in real time, IAST tools are incredibly useful during the testing phase as well. They’re also valuable when the system is in production, because operations and appsec teams can benefit from the risk detection, with little performance hit and little risk of false positives. While IAST tools can provide good benefits, they also are more complex to implement correctly and require mature security development practices and comprehensive build integration in order to recognize their benefits.

            Runtime Application Self-Protection

            While IAST monitors an app for security vulnerabilities while it’s running, runtime application self-protection (RASP) monitors an app to detect and prevent fraudulent activities even before it runs, effectively protecting the app from both known and unknown (zero-day) attack vectors. You can use RASP to gain insight into an app's internal data and state, and identify threats at runtime that may have otherwise been overlooked by other security solutions. When an app begins to run, RASP can protect it from malicious input or behavior by analyzing both the app's behavior and the context of that behavior.

            One advantage of RASP is that it requires minimal intervention of an administrator during deployment. When a security event in an app occurs, RASP takes control of the app and addresses the problem. In diagnostic mode, RASP will simply sound an alarm that something is amiss. In protection mode, it will try to stop it. For this reason, RASP can be beneficial to businesses with lean security resources because it can automatically block attacks on the spot without the need for human intervention. It’s important to first implement RASP in diagnostic mode, to observe how the tool makes decisions, before implementing protection mode.

            You likely use other technologies such as intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and web application firewalls (WAF) to protect your apps at runtime, but these technologies work in-line as they inspect network traffic and content. Although they analyze traffic and user sessions to and from apps, they cannot see how traffic and data are being processed within apps themselves. Additionally, instead of analyzing preset signatures or known patterns based on commonly known attacks, as a WAF would, you can use RASP to look for suspicious actions taking place in the app. 
            Sum It Up

            You now have a better understanding of how to use SAST, DAST, IAST, and RASP to test and secure your mobile apps.

            Next, let’s turn to how to use network and mobile app penetration testing (pen testing) to further secure them.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain network testing.
                Describe mobile application penetration testing.

            Network Testing

            Mobile devices regularly connect to a variety of networks, including public Wi-Fi networks shared with other (potentially malicious) clients. This creates opportunities for a wide variety of network-based attacks ranging from simple to complex and old to new. Therefore, it’s vital to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information exchanged between the mobile application (app) and remote service endpoints. 

            One best practice is to verify your mobile app sets up a secure, encrypted channel for network communication using the latest version of transport layer security (TLS) protocol with appropriate settings.

            Network security specialists, pen testers, and mobile application security (appsec) engineers conduct regular pen testing and vulnerability checks to enable smooth and secure functioning of mobile apps. They test how the app performs under various network types, connection speeds, and quality levels including slow and interrupted connections. They also attempt to circumvent the security of the app by trying to exploit the app’s functionality through pen testing.
            Mobile Application Pen Testing

            A mobile app pen test emulates an attack specifically targeting a custom mobile app and aims to enumerate all vulnerabilities within the app. Pen testing can be used across the entire spectrum of an IT infrastructure, including network, web application, and database. But today, we also see pen testing used widely for another segment: mobile appsec.

             

            You perform pen tests of mobile apps for security vulnerabilities by using either manual or automated techniques to analyze the app. You use these techniques to identify security flaws that may occur in the mobile app. Your purpose in pen testing is to ensure that the mobile app is not vulnerable to attack and that mitigations are in place to prevent exploitation.

            Pen testing requires a diligent effort to find weaknesses, just like an attacker would. You perform deep-dive testing into local on-device security issues, back-end web services, and the application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect them. You customize assessments to specific concerns, such as reverse engineering an iOS app or malware threats to an Android app. 

            During pen testing, you simulate multiple attack vectors and risks, including insecure storage, stolen device risk, mobile malware attacks, and both authenticated and unauthenticated app users. By conducting pen testing, you can gain insights into the application’s vulnerabilities, bottlenecks, and attack vectors before an adversary is able to discover and exploit them. This way, once you identify an app’s shortcomings, your developers can put in fixes to plug these gaps and change the design to address the issues at hand.

            Broadly speaking, mobile app pen testing methodologies include the following stages.

                Discovery: You gather information, which will further form the basis of the pen testing phases.
                Assessment and analysis: You assess the app using static application security testing (SAST), reverse engineering, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and more.
                Exploitation: You find hidden cues which can successfully shed light on different vulnerabilities.
                Reporting: You report the findings via technical reports and executive-level papers.

            Sum It Up

            In this module, you’ve been introduced to the OWASP Mobile Top 10 as a way to identify and mitigate mobile appsec risks. You’ve also learned how to test mobile apps using a variety of techniques.

            Along with the information you reviewed in the Mobile Application Security module, you should now have a better understanding of what it takes to be a mobile appsec engineer. You can learn more about the in-demand cybersecurity skills needed to get a job in mobile appsec, or another field, and learn more from real security practitioners by visiting the Cybersecurity Learning Hub on Trailhead.

            Before You Start

            If you completed The Center for Internet Security's Risk Assessment Method module, then you already know how to develop Risk Assessment and Acceptance Criteria. Now let’s talk about how to use the Center for Internet Security, Inc.’s (CIS) Risk Assessment Method (RAM) to model and evaluate risks and recommend and evaluate CIS Safeguards.

            Note

            Throughout this module, we capitalize common words when referring to a specific component of CIS RAM Version 2.1.
            Identify Information Assets, Safeguards, and Vulnerabilities

            As a cybersecurity risk manager, you can model risks by associating information assets with the CIS Safeguards that protect them, the vulnerabilities that may be present, and the threats that can compromise these information assets. CIS RAM helps analyze risk by describing the component steps regardless of sequence.

                Identify an information asset or asset class, such as a specific firewall or a set of similarly managed firewalls, an application, or a set of identically configured servers, and more.
                Identify threats that can compromise the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of those information assets or Asset Classes.
                List CIS Safeguards that protect the information asset or Asset Class against foreseeable threats.
                Indicate if you have implemented the CIS Safeguards in the environment and how you have implemented them.
                Consider any vulnerabilities that may exist related to each Safeguard and Asset Class. You, as a cybersecurity risk manager, should take care to consider what can go wrong, even if you have implemented Safeguards. Safeguards can have vulnerabilities such as errors in administration, new threats, intentional harm, failed systems, and insufficient skills or resources.

            Let’s check in with Sean, the risk assessor at Custom Car Company (CCC), as he continues to fill out his Risk Register in CIS RAM for Implementation Group 2 (IG2) Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook.

            Sean filling out his Risk Register using CIS RAM for IG2 v2.1 Companion Workbook

            Using the workbook, Sean first selects an Asset Class such as Enterprise, Devices, Applications, Data, Network, or Users. 

            Next, he describes the Asset Name. He selects the CIS Safeguard # and Title that applies to the Asset Class he selected. He then documents how CCC has implemented that Safeguard, including optionally adding Evidence of Implementation, and states any Vulnerabilities that may be exploited by a threat. 

            Note

            This table represents just a few examples of the information Sean inputs.

            Now that Sean has documented CCC’s assets, associated CIS Safeguards, and Vulnerabiliites, he next turns to evaluate the current maturity of CIS Safeguards at CCC.
            Evaluate Current Safeguard Maturity

            As the next step in evaluating risks, Sean selects a score of 1 through 5 designating the reliability of each Safeguard’s effectiveness against threats, using the following definitions. 

                He did not implement the Safeguard, or implemented it inconsistently.
                He implemented the Safeguard  fully on some assets, or partially on all assets.
                He implemented the Safeguard on all assets.
                He tested the Safeguard and corrected inconsistencies.
                He has put in place mechanisms for the Safeguard to ensure consistent implementation over time.

            He populates the Safeguard Maturity Score column in the risk register with his selections.

            Automatically Score Risks

            The VERIS Community Database Index

            Sean now has documented CCC’s assets, their associated Vulnerabilities, and the maturity of CCC’s current CIS Safeguard implementation in protecting against those Vulnerabilities.

            CIS RAM Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook automatically calculates a value to represent how commonly a related threat causes reported cybersecurity incidents. The VERIS Community Database (VCDB) Index column displays this number. This score evaluates the commonality of a threat that a given Safeguard prevents. 

            Expectancy Score

            CIS RAM v2.1 Companion Workbook also automatically calculates an Expectancy Score by comparing the commonality of reported threats to the maturity of the Safeguards that prevent the threats.

            Note

            For more detailed information on how the CIS RAM Version 2.1 (v2.1) Companion Workbook calculates the Expectancy Score, see Appendix C of the CIS-RAM for Implementation Group 2 (IG2) v2.1 PDF.

            Impacts

            Recall that in The Center for Internet Security's Risk Assessment Method module, Sean defined Mission Impact, Operational and Financial Objectives Impact, and Obligations Impact for each Asset Class (Enterprise, Devices, Applications, Data, Network, Users), as part of the process of estimating inherent risk criteria. The CIS RAM v21 Companion workbook automatically populates these magnitudes of harm.

            Risk Score and Risk Level

            Once Sean populates the Safeguard Maturity Score column of CIS RAM v2.1 Companion Workbook, the workbook automatically populates Risk Score and Risk Level.

            The workbook calculates the Risk Score by multiplying the Expectancy Score by the highest Impact Score. The resulting Risk Level is either green, yellow, or red. These colors indicate whether the risk evaluated as “acceptable” as Sean described it in his Risk Acceptance Criteria in the previous module.

                Green indicates that the risk evaluates as acceptable.
                Yellow indicates that the risk is unacceptably high, but not urgent.
                Red indicates that the risk is urgent.

            Sean’s completed Risk Register now looks like this:

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List the benefits of Visual Remote Assistant.
                Describe how a technician or agent uses Visual Remote Assistant.

            Meet the Ursa Major Solar Team

            Ursa Major Solar is an innovative solar company in the American Southwest. It sells individual solar products and complete solar power systems. It uses Field Service to manage the field service team that installs and repairs solar systems. Let’s meet a few members of the team working to improve the field service journey for its customers.

                CEO and cofounder Sita Nagappan-Alvarez. She makes key decisions about software purchases. She’s always on the lookout for ways to improve customer service while keeping her employees happy.
                Salesforce admin Maria Jimenez. She’s the go-to person for setting up and maintaining Salesforce and Field Service. If you have a question about Salesforce, Maria has the answer.
                Customer support agent Ada Balewa. She takes customer calls and solves their problems. Sometimes she refers customers to technicians, and sometimes she solves their problems herself.
                Field Service technician James Clifton. He fixes customers’ solar products. James works with all Ursa Major Solar’s products, and he’s happy to bring sunshine to its customers.

            Make Service Easier and Safer for Customers

            Sita keeps Ursa Major Solar at the forefront of the industry by making sure she knows what her customers want and what they don’t. These days, customers don’t want to have service technicians in their homes as often. While they’re happy with the service provided by technicians like Ada and James, they’d like to have Ursa Major help them perform simple jobs themselves.

            Having agents or technicians investigate problems in customers’ homes without going inside seems like an unsolvable problem. Then Sita discovers Visual Remote Assistant. Visual Remote Assistant lets a contact center agent or remote technician see what the customer sees via video session. Now Ursa Major can provide the same exceptional service without being in the customer’s house using real-time visual support. A quick wave of a customer’s mobile device shows the agent or technician which product is installed, the settings it’s currently using, and more.

            Visual Remote Assistant ties into Ursa Major’s existing Field Service product, so remote technicians can easily see customer information. Details like product type, installation date, and previous visits to the customer’s home are easy to access. Technicians don’t waste time asking questions they’ve asked before and save time for the customer and Ursa Major. Even better, customer problems are often resolved in the first call, without the customer having to schedule a service call and wait for a technician.

            What they see varies depending on how it’s set up in their org, but here’s what an Ursa Major agent or technician sees during a call.

            Graphic showing the incoming phone call, customer information, and the pane to launch Visual Remote Assistant.

                Call (1)—What the customer sees during the Visual Remote Assistant session.
                Customer information (2)—The agent or technician’s page shows customer contact information, the installed assets, past work orders for this customer, and more.
                Visual Remote Assistant pane (3)—Where an agent or technician starts Visual Remote Assistant, allowing them to see what the customer sees and guide them to resolve their issue.

            Visual Remote Assistant in Action

            Let’s say that Ada Balewa is on the phone with a customer named Violet Winkle. Violet is having trouble with a leaky solar hot water heater. Ursa Major has been called out before about this leaky hot water heater, so Ada quickly reads the notes in the work order on that visit. Ada suspects a loose pipe fitting, but she has to see the hot water heater to be sure.

            She suggests that they transition to a video call so she can see what’s going on with Violet’s hot water heater. Violet agrees and Ada uses Visual Remote Assistant to send a text to Violet. Violet taps the link and it sends her to a web page in her mobile browser. She approves the terms and conditions and allows Visual Remote Assistant to access her phone’s camera for the duration of the call. Now Ada can see everything that Violet sees.

            Ada asks Violet to point her phone at the leak and follow it back. She quickly spots the problem. It’s a leaking pipe fitting, just like she thought. When she tries to explain its location, Violet doesn’t understand, so Ada draws a big red arrow on her screen. Because Visual Remote Assistant uses augmented reality, the arrow shows up on Violet’s phone screen too. Now they can both see where the problem is.

            Ada tells Violet to turn the fitting to the right to tighten it. After Violet does, she wipes off the pipe with a towel and checks that it’s no longer leaking. Problem solved! Violet takes a picture of the fixed pipe and it’s added to her user record so the next time she calls, Ursa Major will have that history.

            Visual Remote Assistant allows Ursa Major to resolve issues the first time around. If more help is needed, agents or technicians can add a subject matter expert to the session.

            If they can’t solve the problem right away, the agent or technician can figure out the next steps. Next steps include things like ordering parts, walking the customer through installing the new parts, or scheduling an onsite service call.

            Let’s watch a company resolving a customer problem using Visual Remote Assistant.

            Sita understands the value that Visual Remote Assistant can bring to Ursa Major Solar. She’s happy to see that it allows Ursa Major a way to deliver exceptional service from anywhere. Then the team can give the customer real-time visual feedback to diagnose and even fix problems without going onsite. She’s excited to use Visual Remote Assistant at Ursa Major.

            Set Up Visual Remote Assistant
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List the prerequisites for using Visual Remote Assistant.
                Install the Visual Remote Assistant managed package.
                Train agents and field service technicians to work with customers using Visual Remote Assistant.

            Are You Ready?

             Ursa Major’s admin, Maria, makes sure that she has everything set up to use Visual Remote Assistant. She runs through the list of prerequisites.

                Service Cloud or Field Service licenses. Ursa Major uses Field Service, so it’s already enabled, customized, and the permissions are set up.
                Lightning Experience. Ursa Major uses Lightning Experience, too, so that’s ready.
                Licenses for Visual Remote Assistant. Sita worked with her Salesforce Account Executive to purchase the necessary licenses.
                The correct permission sets.

            Maria has everything she needs. She’s ready to get started.
            Install the Managed Package

            Maria is ready to install the Visual Remote Assistant managed package. For a business org, you may want to install new packages in a sandbox org first to test them but here we install directly into your Trailhead playground.

            Note

             We assume you're a Visual Remote Assistant administrator with the proper permissions and licenses to install and use the managed package. If that's not the case, that’s OK. Read along to learn how your administrator would take the steps in a production org. Don't try to follow these steps in your Trailhead Playground. Visual Remote Assistant isn't available in the Trailhead Playground.

                Open an incognito browser window in Chrome.
                In the incognito window, paste this link http://sfdc.co/visualremoteassistant-install into the address bar.
                On the Salesforce login screen, enter the username and password for your org, then click Log In.
                Enter the verification code from your email.
                Select Install for Admins Only, select the acknowledgment, then click Install.
                Approve the request to grant access to third-party websites.
                Wait for a message telling you that you’ll be notified by email when the package is installed, and click Done.
                Check your email for notification that the package installed.

            It can take a few minutes, but when the installation is complete, check out what you’ve installed. In the App Launcher, search for visual.

            App Launcher displaying selections for Visual Remote Assistant, Visual Remote Assistant - API Details, Account Details and more.

            Maria selects Visual Remote Assistant to see more.
            Train Employees

            Ada and James work together to develop a training program for agents and technicians. Ada is responsible for the agent perspective and James focuses on how technicians use Visual Remote Assistant.

            They create a list of common scenarios that can benefit from a visual connection to the customer. The list includes basic in-home repairs. Here’s part of Ursa Major’s list of tasks that customers can perform. It’s not a full list, but it gives you a sense of Ursa Major’s goals.

                Examine hot water heaters leaking inside the house for loose connections or defective parts.
                If solar panels on the ground are losing efficiency, visually inspect them for loose debris.
                Check to make sure that all connections are securely fastened.
                Use optical character recognition (OCR) to convert barcodes, QR codes, and more into text to look up panel warranty, item number, and more.

            Then they create a list of common scenarios where a visit must be scheduled. For example, some tasks are too dangerous for a customer to attempt. Instead, a knowledgeable technician must come onsite to fix the problem. Ursa Major never compromises on customer safety.

                Don’t attempt to fix problems with electrical components that could shock or injure the customer.
                Don’t have customers climb onto their roof or go to any area that’s dangerous to access.
                Don’t disassemble complex components that require a delicate touch or specialized expertise.

            Finally, they list the tasks that agents and technicians must perform to use Visual Remote Assistant.

                Decide if it’s a case for Visual Remote Assistant.
                Locate and start Visual Remote Assistant.
                Walk customers through connecting their mobile device.
                Take pictures to include in the record or forward to a subject matter expert.
                Use augmented reality to add information to a customer’s phone display, like arrows or circles.
                Know when to add a subject matter expert to the agent’s ongoing session.
                Know when to schedule a follow-up appointment.

            Now that Ada and James have the training information, they decide to create a Sales Enablement badge to train their team members. After a team member completes the badge, they shadow a trained team member for a day to see Visual Remote Assistant in action. After that, they’re ready to start helping customers in a whole new way.

            In this module, you learned the benefits of Visual Remote Assistant and how agents and technicians use it to work with customers. Then, an Ursa Major admin installed the Visual Remote Assistant managed package. Finally, Ursa Major trained team members to help customers solve their problems more quickly and easily than ever before.

            Learn the Foundations of Carbon Accounting
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:  

                Explain the basic Greenhouse Gas (GHG) accounting principles.
                Describe the different objects that work to create a carbon accounting framework. 

            Before We Start

            If you completed the Net Zero Cloud Basics module, then you already know how Northern Trail Outfitters uses Net Zero Cloud to support and scope their climate strategy. Not to mention Net Zero Cloud Admin Essentials module which outlined how an admin can set up and configure the application. If you haven’t completed these modules, we recommend taking them to have more context as you dive into carbon accounting.
            Account for Your Actions

            The world is in a climate crisis and the need to reduce carbon emissions has never been more urgent. Regulators, investors, and customers are urging companies to get to net zero faster. Companies are faced with the challenge of tracking the complete spectrum of their value chain emissions, which can be a complex and cumbersome process. In this module, we’ll look at how Net Zero Cloud can help you meet that challenge. 

            Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) is using Salesforce’s Net Zero Cloud to collect, analyze, and report energy usage data and track their carbon footprint. As a part of its net zero commitment, NTO plans to track its carbon footprint and set long-term goals to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
            How Net Zero Cloud Can Help

            Today, companies are generally expected to gather data on their emissions-producing activities, calculate, and report their contribution to atmospheric emissions, and reduce emissions across all three scopes. Check out this help topic to see examples of how emissions are qualified as scope 1, 2, and 3. Net Zero Cloud makes this entire carbon accounting process easy and streamlined for a company like NTO. Net Zero Cloud provides the tools to quantify and measure carbon emissions, and helps companies make informed decisions about which mitigation strategies will be most effective.

            In Net Zero Cloud, all emissions are converted to their carbon dioxide equivalents and are reported in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). Wondering what tCO₂e means? tCO₂e is a standardized unit for counting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, regardless of whether they're from carbon dioxide or another gas, such as methane, nitrous oxide, or one of the dozens of refrigerants used throughout the world today.

            Net Zero Cloud helps companies create an annual emissions inventory. A GHG inventory is the basis for efforts to reduce emissions and their associated environmental impacts. Once you know what your emissions are, it’s easier to tackle the process of reducing the impact of these emissions. An accurate GHG inventory also helps companies forecast emissions in future years.

            Calculating GHG emissions also enables companies like NTO to set science-based emissions reduction targets. An accurate GHG inventory is the required starting point for determining which targets should be set and for determining how to quantify these targets.

            Let’s follow along as Sam Rajan, the Chief Sustainability Officer at NTO, explores carbon accounting using Net Zero Cloud for all stationary and vehicle asset sources.

            Sam Rajan, the Chief Sustainability Officer at NTO.
            Explore the Building Blocks of Carbon Accounting

            There are four key building blocks in Net Zero Cloud that help users manage the carbon accounting process.

                Emissions Sources: Emissions sources represent the assets of an enterprise that generate carbon emissions. The three types of emissions sources in Net Zero Cloud are:

                    Stationary Asset Environmental Sources: Assets that are stationary in nature, such as office buildings, data centers, or warehouses.
                    Vehicle Asset Emissions Sources: Assets that are mobile in nature, such as company vehicles or private jets.
                    Scope 3 Emissions Sources: Scope 3 activities that are the source of emissions, such as transportation, purchase of raw materials, hotel stays, and so on. This category of emissions results from the activities of the company that are from sources not owned or controlled by the company.

                Energy Use Records: Energy use records are created for a specific date or date range and are associated with an emissions source. Examples include monthly electricity consumption for a stationary asset or a single commercial flight record. Users can enter energy consumption information, such as the quantity of electricity, diesel, or natural gas consumed, over a specific period of time in various units of measure that are specific to the activity or fuel being consumed. Based on the emissions factors referenced by the energy use record, Net Zero Cloud does the work for you by converting the entered consumption into carbon emissions.
                Emissions Factors: Emissions factors are used to convert energy consumption into GHG emissions. Several emissions factors in the form of reference datasets from standard government or private sources are preconfigured in Net Zero Cloud. Examples include the eGRID dataset for electricity subgrid emissions in the United States and the EEIO datasets that estimate tCO2e per monetary output across most of the 8 upstream scope 3 categories. Emissions factors specific to a region, business sector, or country can also be added to Net Zero Cloud.
                Carbon Footprints: A carbon footprint is an estimate of the amount of CO2e released to the environment during the lifecycle of a product or an activity. Carbon footprints primarily exist to summarize values from multiple energy use records. There are three types of carbon footprints in Net Zero Cloud, corresponding to the three types of emissions sources.

                    Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions by scope, summarized from underlying energy uses for a stationary asset across all fuel types. Net Zero Cloud automatically creates Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Item records to show summarized emissions information for a single fuel type.
                    Vehicle Asset Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions by scope, summarized from underlying energy uses for a vehicular asset.
                    Scope 3 Carbon Footprint: Contains overall emissions from underlying energy uses for a scope 3 activity. While you can associate a Scope 3 Emissions Source to the carbon footprint record, you can also associate a stationary source. For example, a warehouse can be the epicenter of scope 3 activities such as purchase of goods and services, transportation and distribution, and waste generation. You can associate the required energy use records and procurement summary records to determine from which activities you want to calculate emissions. 

            Now that Sam understands the building blocks for carbon accounting, he maps out the connections between these objects.

            Track Emissions for Stationary Assets
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List the key fields on a stationary asset environmental source record.
                Explain how to specify values for key fields on stationary asset energy use records.
                Show a simple calculation of emissions on a stationary asset energy use record. 

            Take Stock of Your Buildings

            Stationary asset environmental sources are used to represent all buildings and data centers associated with a company. Let’s look at how Sam handles this for NTO. Since all of NTO’s stationary asset records come with a few key fields, Sam creates a record for the NTO Headquarters and reviews and populates the key fields.

            A stationary asset environmental source record showing details for NTO Headquarters Miami.

            Let’s take a deeper dive into these fields and what they represent.

            Field
            	

            Description
            	

            Impact on Calculations

            Carbon Emissions Scope Allocation
            	

            The object that specifies the GHG Protocol scope of emissions for different fuels. Each fuel type has its own scope allocation record in the Carbon Emissions Scope Allocation Values object.
            	

            This field helps the user specify the scope to which the emissions from each fuel is allocated.

            Refrigerant Emissions Factor
            	

            The object that holds the global warming potential (GWP) for cooling refrigerants, such as CFCs, HFCs, and HCFCs used in stationary asset sources. You can create one record per refrigerant type.
            	

            To properly calculate tCO₂e from refrigerant leakage, the refrigerant’s GWP is multiplied by the quantity of refrigerant leakage.

            Electricity Emissions Factor Set
            	

            The object that holds a range of information that's relevant to calculating the scope 2 emissions generated from electricity. The GHG Protocol provides two methods for tracking scope 2 emissions: the market-based method and the location-based method. There are fields specific to both of these methods in the electricity emissions factor set.
            	

            Yearly datasets from sources such as Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) website can be uploaded to accurately calculate electricity-based emissions in a specific postal code.

            Other Emissions Factor Set
            	

            The object that holds predefined emissions and conversion factors for emissions resulting from use of natural gas, propane, and on-site diesel use. While in the other emissions factor record, you can define the global warming potential values for CH₄ and N₂O, in the associated other emissions factor set item records, you can specify values for different fuel types, such as gasoline, LPG, or biodiesel.
            	

            All individual emissions and conversion factors for sources that are not included in the electricity grid or scope 3 data types are captured as part of the Other Emissions Factors.

            Regional Building Energy Intensity
            	

            Lookup to a building energy intensity record from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data. The CBECS is a national sample survey that collects energy usage information on commercial buildings across the USA. The energy usage data serves as a reliable and publicly available standard, and is preloaded in Net Zero Cloud. The value is automatically populated when the country is the United States, the postal code is valid, and the total floor area is populated in the record.
            	

            NTO can use the CBECS building energy intensity data to plug energy use gaps in the data of commercial buildings (more on this later).
            Energy Use for Stationary Assets

            Buildings and warehouses at NTO use electricity, diesel for backup generators, and refrigerants for cooling. Each of these require separate energy use records associated with the same stationary asset source. 

            Within energy use records, Net Zero Cloud automatically calculates many of the fields based on energy use data and emissions factors.

            Three energy use records associated with a stationary asset environmental source record.
            Data for Key Fields

            Sam works to create the energy use records to allow for emissions calculations. He looks at the information within an energy use record, one section at a time.

            General Information

            On a stationary asset’s energy use record, information like the total and occupied floor area and whether the asset is company-owned helps with calculations. Sam can also specify the stationary asset for which energy consumption is being recorded, the start and end dates of the energy consumption, and the corresponding stationary asset carbon footprint record.

            General information, such as building details, reporting period, and references to the associated asset and carbon footprint on a stationary asset energy use record.

            Consumption

            Depending on the type of fuel for which an energy use record is created, this section helps Sam define the following.

                Fuel type: There are multiple fuel types for which you can enter energy consumption, including Electricity, Diesel, Natural Gas, and Propane.
                Fuel consumption unit: Multiple units of measure are supported natively in Net Zero Cloud corresponding to the different fuel types that are supported. 

            Fuel consumption information on a stationary asset energy use record.

            Emissions Factors 

            If the emissions factors are specified on the stationary asset environmental source, they are automatically inherited by the associated energy use records. Thanks to the flexibility of Net Zero Cloud, Sam can also override the values on each energy use record if he needs to.

            Associated emissions factors for electricity, fuel, and refrigerants on a stationary asset energy use record.

            Supplemental Emissions

            Sam can also specify supplemental emissions for each scope to manually adjust emissions, if needed. These are used in the calculated total emissions.

            Supplemental emissions information on a stationary asset energy use record.

            Grid Mix

            The grid mix values on the energy use record are calculated based on the grid mix percentages specified in the associated electricity emissions factor set record. If he needs to, Sam can override the values for location-based and market-based grid mix on an electricity emissions factor set record based on the information he gets from the suppliers for NTO’s buildings in a specific postal code.

                The market-based grid mix depends on the electricity that organizations have chosen to purchase from specific suppliers and takes supplier-specific emissions rates into consideration.
                The location-based grid mix depends on the emissions intensity of the local grid area where the electricity usage occurs. 

            Location-based and market-based grid mix information on a stationary asset energy use record.

            Renewable Energy

            Renewable energy displays the quantity of electricity that’s generated from renewable sources. Sam can specifically allocate electricity generated from renewable sources in the Renewable Energy Type and Allocated Renewable Energy fields. The basis for the renewable energy calculations is the allocated renewable energy value entered on the energy use record and the market-based grid mix percentage on the electricity emissions factors record.

            Renewable energy information on a stationary asset energy use record.

            Emissions

            A Few Calculations Explained

            Now that Sam has explored the key information on an energy use record for a stationary asset, he tries to understand how the emissions are calculated. Sam creates the following energy use records for the NTO Office Headquarters Miami stationary asset environmental source record.

            Calculation of Electricity Related Emissions

            The United States - US-TX - electricityMap 2019 emissions factor record specifies the following.

                CO₂e Emissions Rate for Location Based Emissions Factors = 396.78 g/kWh
                Location-Based Coal-Mix Percentage: 20%
                Location-Based Gas-Mix Percentage: 47%
                Location-Based Nuclear-Mix Percentage: 11% 

            Emissions factor details on an electricity emissions factor set record.

            Let’s see how the energy values are calculated on the stationary asset energy use record Monthly Electricity Bill Jan.

            Scope 2 Location-Based Emissions (tCO₂e) = Electricity consumption (in kWh) * Emissions factor (g/kWh) / 10^6 (tCO₂e conversion factor) 

                                                                                   = 1000*396.78/1000000 = 0.3968 tCO₂e

            Furthermore, here’s how the information is calculated for the Location-Based Grid Mix.

                Location-Based Electricity from Coal (kWh): 20% of 1000 kWh = 200 kWh
                Location-Based Electricity from Gas (kWh): 47% of 1000 kWh = 470 kWh
                Location-Based Electricity from Nuclear (kWh): 11% of 1000 kWh = 110 kWh 

            Greenhouse gas emissions results and grid mix data on a stationary asset energy use record for electricity.

            A similar approach is followed to calculate market-based electricity emissions by referring to the market-based grid mix percentages.

            Calculation of Diesel Related Emissions

            The Fuel Conversion Factors - DEFRA EPA 2018 factor set record specifies the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values.

                GWP of CH₄: 28
                GWP of N₂O: 265 

            The OEFSI-0000006 factor set item record specifies the following.

            Fuel Type
            	

            Calorific Value

            73.96
            	

            0.06

            The consumption of diesel (1000 Liters) is first converted to its kWh equivalent using its calorific value, which is 15 kWh/L. 

            Total Fuel Consumption = 15000 kWh (1000*15)

            Next, this value is multiplied by the Supplied tCO₂e emissions factor and divided by the conversion factor.

            Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = Supplied tCO₂e Emissions Factor * Total Fuel Consumption/1000 

                                                           = (12.45*15000/1000) = 186.75

            The autocalculated Scope 1 Emissions (tCO2e) value for Diesel on a stationary asset energy use record.

            Calculation of Refrigerant Related Emissions

            Lastly, let’s check out how emissions are calculated when the fuel type is Refrigerant. The Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) - IPCC AR4 2007 refrigerant emissions factor record specifies the Global Warming Potential as 22,800.

            Here’s how the emissions calculation shapes up.

            Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = GWP * Fuel Consumption(kg)/1000 

                                                         = 22,800*10/1000 = 228

            Greenhouse gas emission results on a stationary asset energy use record for Refrigerant.

            In the next unit, Sam creates a carbon footprint for this stationary asset and learns more about the calculations. Let’s follow along with him.

            Manage Carbon Footprint Records for Stationary Assets
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List the key fields on stationary asset carbon footprint records.
                Explain how scope allocation is determined for various fuel sources.
                Describe how emissions are calculated for a data center. 

            Introduction to Carbon Footprints

            Sam is making great progress! He defined emissions sources and energy uses for stationary assets and looked at how emissions are calculated in the Net Zero Cloud app. Now he concentrates on rolling up the emissions data to a carbon footprint record. Sam can attach multiple stationary asset energy use records to a stationary asset carbon footprint record to get a single calculated carbon footprint for an asset.

            While a stationary asset carbon footprint shows the tCO₂e emissions for an asset, its child records, Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Items, show the tCO₂e emissions for individual fuel types. So, if Sam creates a carbon footprint record to calculate the total tCO₂e emissions for the NTO Headquarters for 2021, he can also have carbon footprint items that show emissions separately from, say, electricity, natural gas, and diesel.

            Note that while Sam can manually create carbon footprint records and associate them with energy use records, the application can also do this for him. If a carbon footprint record exists for a given period, all new energy use records falling within that period get automatically associated with this carbon footprint record. If Sam creates a new energy use record and it covers a time period for which a carbon footprint record does not yet exist, Net Zero Cloud automatically creates a new carbon footprint and associates the energy record with it. This saves Sam a lot of time.

            Note

            Only the energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are automatically rolled up into the carbon footprint record that he creates. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to get View All or Modify All permission for the required records.

            When Sam attaches energy use records to a carbon footprint record, the scope 1, 2, and 3 calculations of the energy use records automatically sum to a total value shown in the carbon footprint record. Just like for individual energy use records, Sam can also manually specify supplemental emissions by scope on all carbon footprint record types.
            Stationary Asset Carbon Footprints

            The following key data points are available on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

            General Information

            Sam can specify the Stationary Asset Environment Source to which this footprint is associated, the reporting period of the carbon footprint, the stage of the footprint in the overall lifecycle, the previous year’s annual carbon footprint record, and the audit approval status. Sam can also select the allocation status for renewable energy used in the asset source.

            Building Details

            Sam can specify the building energy intensity lookup and the regional building energy intensity lookup that can be used to resolve gaps in the energy consumption data for a commercial building stationary asset (more on this in the next unit). 

            If the Stationary Asset Environmental Source record for this footprint is already associated with a Regional Building Energy Intensity record, then the same Regional Building Energy Intensity record is automatically populated in the Carbon Footprint record. However, Sam needs to identify the Building Energy Intensity record that is most applicable to the building’s carbon footprint and select that record. 

            Building Details section on a Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint record.

            Greenhouse Gas Emissions

            Sam can see the autocalculated values for Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2 Market-Based, Total Scope 2 Location-Based, Total Scope 3 Upstream, and Total Scope 3 Downstream Emissions (tCO₂e) for the associated source. The values are derived by summing up values from the underlying energy use records.

            Greenhouse gas emissions results on a stationary asset Carbon footprint record.

            Total Energy Use Summaries

            Total Energy Consumption for the stationary asset source is calculated in kilowatt-hours, megawatt-hours, and gigajoules. Sam can also see the Total Building Indirect Energy Consumption (MWh), which is the consumption of energy specifically from electricity, heat, cooling, and steam, and excludes emissions from other fuels.

            Total energy use summaries on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

            Renewable Energy Details

            Based on the allocation status of the carbon footprint, Sam can see the Total Renewable Energy generated, both in absolute kWh and as a percentage of the overall electricity consumed. Also, he can see allocated renewable energy expressed in kWh, which is the renewable energy explicitly defined in energy use records. Sam can refer to these values to check the proportion of renewable or “cleaner” sources of energy used for each asset. This positions him better to meet his goal of increasing the allocated renewable energy percentage. 

            Renewable energy details on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

            Grid Mix Information

            Sam can see the rolled up values from all electricity energy use records for both location-based and market-based grid mix data for the asset source. And just like for energy use records, the data is categorized by fuel sources, such as biomass, coal, solar, wind, and oil. This makes it easy for Sam to see the big picture but also hone in on the fuel source components and how they each play a role.

            Location-based and market-based grid mix data on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

            Energy Use Intensity Comparisons

            Sam can see the total regional electricity consumption intensity and the percentage difference between the regional intensity and the intensity of the associated carbon footprint item for electricity consumption. Sam can use this information to understand how far off a particular stationary asset is from the average electricity consumption in that region. If the variance is too high, maybe it’s time to make the building more energy-efficient.

            Energy use intensity comparisons on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

            Data Quality Metrics

            Sam can view the average monthly electricity consumption and the energy consumption intensities for the current and previous years, calculated both in square meters and square feet. Another handy value is to check the maximum variance above and below the average expressed as a percentage. This is super useful for Sam to understand the role seasonality plays and to identify any data abnormalities.

            Data quality metrics on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.
            Footprint Items

            The Stationary Asset Carbon Footprint Items for a Carbon Footprint contain data for an individual fuel type. Let’s take the example from the previous unit to see a snapshot of how data rolls up in Net Zero Cloud.

            Three carbon footprint items, each for a different fuel type, associated with a parent carbon footprint for a stationary asset.

            Here’s a way to see how carbon footprint items roll up data based on fuel type, and how carbon footprints roll up data based on consolidated energy consumption across all fuel types.

            The following key information can be found on a stationary asset carbon footprint item record.

                Total Emissions (tCO₂e) from the fuel type.
                Total Energy Consumption of the Fuel Type, expressed in kWh equivalent, even if the underlying fuel is not electricity.
                Energy Consumption Intensity of the Fuel Type for the current and previous years. 

            Intensity metrics on a stationary asset carbon footprint item record, where fuel type is electricity.
            What’s the Scope?

            For each energy consumption record entered, there is a default scope against which the emissions are recorded based on the fuel type and asset ownership. The asset ownership is determined by the Company-Owned Asset checkbox on an asset’s record. The associated energy use records inherit this status from the asset, but it can also be overridden.

            To understand the default scope allocation performed by Net Zero Cloud for various fuel types and for assets owned and leased by the reporting company, check out Stationary Asset Energy Use. 

            There are typical allocations based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance, but exceptions occur frequently in the world of carbon accounting. There can be instances where Sam needs to change the default scope allocation for a specific asset source. For example, NTO might own the building, and therefore consider most fuels to be scope 1, while leasing equipment and considering emissions from that equipment to be scope 3. These determinations are often made with the help of experienced consultants.

            The default scope allocations in Net Zero Cloud can be overridden through the Scope Allocation capability, where Sam can assign the scope into which a particular fuel type’s emissions must be aggregated. To do this, he creates a new carbon emissions scope allocation record, manually sets each individual fuel’s allocation to a scope in the child records, and then assigns the new carbon emissions scope allocation record to his asset. By using Scope Allocation, Net Zero Cloud users have ultimate flexibility in how they account for their GHG emissions.

            Data Centers as Asset Sources

            NTO, being a retail company, doesn’t operate any data centers. But there are companies who do, and they must define their data centers as stationary asset environmental sources. The reason that data centers are considered a special case in Net Zero Cloud is because of the way total electricity usage in the facility is estimated from known electricity consumption of the IT equipment. 

            A Salesforce admin can configure the record type for the asset and information can be captured for data centers, similar to commercial buildings. While most calculations are similar for emissions, there are two major differences.

                If the fuel type on a stationary asset energy use record is Electricity for a data center asset source, the user must specify a value for the field Power Usage Effectiveness. Generally a value between 1 and 2, this is the ratio of the total amount of energy used by a data center to the energy delivered to just the computing equipment. The calculated emissions are scaled up by this value to calculate tCO₂e for electricity. For other fuel types, there are no changes to calculated emissions.
                The Power Usage Effectiveness field on a stationary asset energy use record for a data center.
                Therefore, for data center assets, Total Fuel Consumption (kWh) = Fuel Consumption (kWh) * Power Usage Effectiveness
                In the other emissions factor set, there’s a provision to show the Data Center Refrigerant Leakage Rate value expressed in kg/IT kWh, which specifies the leakage rate of the refrigerant used for cooling the data center's computing equipment.
                The Data Center Refrigerant Leakage Rate field on another emissions factor set record.

            On a stationary asset carbon footprint record, the following values are autocalculated when the associated asset is a Data Center.

                Average Data Center Power Usage Effectiveness
                Data Center IT Diesel Consumption Intensity
                Previous Year Data Center Power Usage Effectiveness

            Sam has explored carbon accounting for stationary assets and learned about the calculations. In the next unit, let’s follow along as Sam uses Net Zero Cloud to fill gaps in the carbon footprint data.

            Benchmark Building Energy Intensity and Fill Gaps in the Carbon Footprint Data
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List the possible data gaps in a carbon footprint record.
                Explain building benchmarks.
                List the steps to fill gaps in a carbon footprint record. 

            No Data, No Worries!

            NTO has many buildings across the globe. The company uses several energy sources to heat and cool the buildings, and power gadgets and devices. As we saw in the earlier unit, Net Zero Cloud uses energy use records to calculate the carbon footprint. Sam uses the monthly utility bills to obtain the energy consumption data for these assets, which he then feeds into Net Zero Cloud as energy use records. 

            But there’s a problem. Electricity bills for a couple of months for a few of NTO’s buildings aren’t available. And there’s no way for Sam to know the total energy usage for these months. 

            Any gaps in the energy use data can cause inaccurate carbon footprint accounting, which can lead to incorrect annual emissions inventories. We can’t stress enough the need for reliable and auditable carbon inventories for accurate sustainability impact reporting. 

            Here’s a list of situations that can cause gaps in the energy use data. 

                Missing energy consumption data: The monthly energy consumption bills are missing or the data is unavailable for some reason.
                Orphan energy use records: Energy use records that share the reporting year and organization asset with a carbon footprint (CF) record but aren’t linked to the CF record yet.
                Date issues: Two or more energy use records cover the same reporting period but have issues with dates. For example, missing start or end dates, start or end dates being out of range over the same reporting period, or overlapping start and end dates. 

            So what should Sam do? Fortunately, Net Zero Cloud provides a quick and easy way to intelligently identify gaps in the carbon footprint data and fill them. Sam can use industry benchmarks or create custom benchmarks.

            Note

            Data gap filling is available only for stationary assets with the Commercial Building record type. As part of the initial configuration for stationary assets, the Salesforce admin creates the Commercial Building record type. (To learn more about the admin setup, see the Net Zero Cloud Admin Essentials Trailhead module.)
            Benchmark Your Building Energy Usage

            Net Zero Cloud supports the use of the following benchmarking approaches to fill in the missing energy use data. 

            Use Industry Benchmark 

            The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) is a national sample survey that researches and collects energy-related building characteristics and energy usage data of U.S. commercial buildings. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes CBECS results.

            For reference data, the Salesforce admin loads the CBECS industry benchmark data into Regional Building Energy Intensity data records.

            Create and Use Your Own Benchmark

            Sam can use BEI Builder in Net Zero Cloud to compute a benchmark and develop insights into the average energy usage across all NTO buildings. Sam can then use the benchmark for filling in the gaps for buildings with missing energy use data. These numbers are stored in Building Energy Intensity (BEI) data records. BEI is measured in kWh/sqft or kWh/m² per year.
            Create a Building Energy Intensity Record Using BEI Builder

            BEI Builder guides Sam through the process of creating BEI records for NTO’s commercial buildings. It calculates the benchmark by averaging energy consumption values from existing energy use records. 

             

            Note

            Only energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are automatically pulled into the BEI record that Sam creates. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to get View All or Modify All permission for all the required records.

            Energy use records that meet certain filter criteria are considered for BEI calculation. Let’s go over these criteria.

            Averaging Window Start Date and Averaging Window End Date

            Energy use records must belong to the period defined by these dates. 

            Building Size Category 

            Energy use records must be for assets whose total floor area falls in the range defined by the building size category record. For more information, see Create a Building Size Category record.

             

            Note

            BEI Builder uses the occupied floor area of buildings to calculate the BEI to ensure that usage is estimated for the occupied space in which the energy was consumed. 

            The floor area values are retrieved from the corresponding stationary asset environmental source record for the asset.

             

            Building Asset Type

            The buildings must be of the asset type defined by Building Asset Type. Asset types can be Office, Restaurant, or Hotel.

            Note

            Ensure that the record type for the asset is mapped with the stationary asset type - Commercial Building.

            GeographicalArea

            The buildings must be from the business region or country defined by Geographical Area.

            Energy consumption of buildings can vary depending on the climate and other external factors that are specific to a geographical area. Hence, geographical area information plays a key role in creating a distinct benchmark that’s used for data gap filling.

            If Sam wants to include energy use records that are created during the data gap filling process, he can select the System Generated Energy Use Records Included checkbox.

            On clicking Create, the Calculate Building Energy Intensity data processing job runs in the backend to calculate BEI and create a record. The Salesforce admin has already activated this data processing engine job template. For more information about BEI calculations, see Building Energy Intensity Calculations.
            Using CBECS vs BEI

            Whether you use the industry benchmark (CBECS) data or your own benchmark for filling data gaps depends on your organization’s requirements and preferences. For example, organizations can choose CBECS for buildings in the USA as it’s reliable and has been validated by government agencies. If CBECS data isn’t available for a certain fuel type or region, or the organization wants to use its own benchmark, you’d go with BEI.

            Let’s follow along as Sam uses Net Zero Cloud to identify and fill data gaps in one of the CF records.
            Fill Data Gaps in Carbon Accounting with Net Zero Cloud

            To get started, Sam selects Fill Data Gaps from the action menu of a carbon footprint record, which launches a wizard. Data gap filling in Net Zero Cloud is a three-step process.

             

            Step 1. Associate the orphan energy use records with the carbon footprint record.

            The first page lists energy use records that match the reporting year and organization asset of the CF record but aren’t yet associated with this or any other CF record. 

             

            Sam reviews the list, selects the ones that must be associated with the CF record, and clicks Save. The selected records get associated with the CF record and are removed from the list.

            Note

            Only the energy use records that Sam has created, or to which he has at least View All access, are displayed in the list.

            Sam clicks Next to move to the next step. 

            Step 2. Fix energy use report dates.

            The next page lists energy use records that are associated with the CF record but have issues with dates. 

             

            By default, the list shows all such records but Sam can choose to view records with specific issues only. For example, to view records with missing dates, Sam keeps only the Missing dates checkbox selected and clicks Search to refresh the list. 

            Sam fixes the dates and clicks Save, and then clicks Next to move to the final step.

            Step 3. For fuel types with missing energy use data, create and associate energy use records.

            Steps 1 and 2 helped Sam identify and associate unassociated energy use records with the CF record, and correct date issues in associated energy use records. The final step is to fill the data gaps.

            Sam must select the fuel type for which he wants to fill the data gaps, and the fill method. He selects Cooling for the fuel type and Regional Building Energy Intensity for the fill method. The page shows record entries for the period with missing data and suggested values in the Fill Data (kWh) column. 

             

            In the case of Regional Building Energy Intensity fill method, Net Zero Cloud uses the intensity value from the preloaded CBECS data.

            This fill method is available only if a Regional BEI record is associated with the CF record (Regional Building Energy Intensity field).

            Record entries on the page provide details of the energy use records that will be automatically created. Sam selects the desired entries per fuel type and saves the changes before clicking Finish. 

            The corresponding energy use records are created. Sam notices that the System Generated Record checkbox in the Data Gap Filling Audit Information section of each of these records is selected. 

             

            Likewise, Sam reviews, identifies, and fixes data gaps and inconsistencies in other CF records. 

            Let’s see how Net Zero Cloud calculates the suggested values when we select other fill methods. 

            Building Energy Intensity: Net Zero Cloud uses the intensity value that Sam created using BEI Builder.

            This method is available only if a BEI record is associated with the CF record (Building Energy Intensity field). 

            Previous Year Daily Average: Net Zero Cloud computes and uses the average daily energy consumption data from the previous year. This method is available only if the previous year’s CF record is associated with the Previous Year Annual Carbon Footprint field in the CF record, and if at least one energy use record for the selected fuel type exists. 

             

            Current Year Daily Average: Net Zero Cloud computes and uses the average daily energy consumption data from the current year. This method is available only if at least one energy use record for the selected fuel type exists.

            Manual: Sam must enter the energy use data for filling the gap manually. 

             

            Sam is now ready to see how carbon accounting works for vehicle assets. Let’s find out in the next unit.

            Track Carbon Emissions for Vehicle Asset Sources
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List the key fields on vehicle asset records.
                List the key fields on vehicle asset energy use records.
                Explain how to calculate emissions from vehicle assets. 

            NTO’s Vehicle Assets

            NTO has two key vehicle emissions sources to account for: the private jets that NTO operates and the shuttle cars that are used for employee commuting. Sam creates a company-owned asset for a private jet used by the CEO of the company, and a record for the company shuttle in the Miami region, which they lease from a local car rental company for employee commutes. 

            While most fields remain similar for the vehicle emissions sources, Sam takes a look at the key fields that impact emissions calculations.

                Vehicle type: Based on the record types configured by the admin, you can select the type of vehicle for which you want to calculate emissions. NTO can select between Fleet Vehicles and Private Jets.
                Other emissions factors: Lookup to the object that holds reference data for emissions from various fuel sources. Other emissions factor item records associated with the parent other emissions factor set record contains emissions factors for different fuel types, such as jet fuel, gasoline, diesel, or CNG. 

            Apart from these key fields, Sam can also add additional information, such as the scope allocation, lease ID, lease expiration date, vehicle ID, and business region on a vehicle asset emissions source record.

            Energy Use Records for Vehicle Assets

            Let’s turn our attention to energy use. Now that he’s recorded his vehicle assets, Sam can specify supplier-provided fuel consumption data. Here are the details that Sam can specify on the energy use record.

                Fuel consumption details: Depending on the type of asset, fuel type can either be jet fuel for private jets, or any other fuel for fleet vehicles, such as biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), diesel, or gasoline. Sam can also specify fuel consumption values in liters or gallons from gas station bills and fuel refill receipts.
                Distance: This is the distance traveled by a company car or the private jet for the reporting period. Distance can be specified in kilometers or miles.
                Aircraft details: Sam can specify the type of aircraft, which impacts the fuel efficiency and consumption patterns. From the flight receipts, Sam can also specify the flight duration and flight date. 

            The following attributes are auto calculated based on the values provided and the data that is in an emissions factor record linked to.

                Fuel Efficiency
                CH₄, CO₂, and N₂O Emissions (kg)
                Scope-Based Emissions (tCO₂e)
                Total Fuel Consumption in US Gallons and Liters
                Aircraft Fuel Economy (Gallons per Hour) 

            User-specified and autocalculated fields on a vehicle asset energy use record.
            Vehicle Asset Carbon Footprint

            Now it’s time for Sam to create a carbon footprint record for each vehicle asset that he’d specified earlier to calculate the total carbon emissions from a vehicle represented in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). The conversion factors from the associated Other Emissions Factors and related Other Emissions Factor Items are used to calculate the emissions.

            The following key data points are available on a vehicle asset carbon footprint record.

                Total fuel use: Sam can view the total fuel usage for a vehicle in gallons and in liters. The values are rolled up from the associated energy use records for the vehicle.
                Supplemental emissions: Sam can also specify supplemental emissions by scope to manually adjust emissions, if needed. These are added to the calculated total emissions.
                Greenhouse gas emissions: Sam can see the auto calculated values for Total Scope 1, Total Scope 2 Market-Based, Total Scope 2 Location-Based, Total Scope 3 Upstream and Total Scope 3 Downstream Emissions (tCO₂e) for the associated source.

            Calculations for Vehicle Emissions

            The following information is available on a vehicle asset energy use record for a fleet vehicle asset source such as NTO’s company shuttle.

            Field
            	

            Value

            Name
            	

            Miami Shuttle Fueling Receipt 2/3/21

            Reporting Period
            	

            2/3/2021 - 2/3/2021

            Distance
            	

            100 miles

            Fuel Type
            	

            Diesel

            Fuel Consumption
            	

            100 liters

            The data inputs on a vehicle asset energy use record.

            First, Net Zero Cloud converts the fuel consumption to gallons. 100 liters = 26.42 gallons.

            Next, let’s look at the information in the  other emissions factor set record. The fuel conversion factors - DEFRA EPA 2018 record has an associated other emissions factor item record that holds the emissions factors for Diesel. The values are as follows.

            Field
            	

             Value

            CO₂ Emissions Factor
            	

            9.75 g/US gal

            N₂O Emissions Factor
            	

            0.3 g/US gal

            CH₄ Emissions Factor
            	

            0.12 g/US gal

            So, for 26.4 gallons of Diesel, the mass of CO₂, N₂O, and CH₄ generated is calculated by applying the emissions factors.

                CO2: 26.42*9.75*0.001 = 0.257568 kg
                N20: 26.4*0.3*0.001 = 0.007925 kg
                CH4: 26.4*0.12*0.001 = 0.003170 kg 

            Note that the contribution of N₂O and CH₄ emissions in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents is not 1:1. This equivalence is obtained from the global warming potential (GWP) values referred to in the other emissions factors record.

                N₂O GWP = 265
                CH₄ GWP = 28 

            Scope 1 Emissions (tCO₂e) = {CO₂ Emissions (Kg) /1000} + {N₂O Emissions (Kg) /1000 *N₂O GWP} + {CH₄ Emissions (Kg)/1000 * CH₄ GWP}

                                                         = {0.257568/1000} + {0.007925/1000*265} + {0.003170/1000*28} = 0.0024

            Similar calculations are carried out for private jets by referring to the fuel conversion factors for jet fuel and other values, such as aircraft fuel economy.
            What’s Next?

            Let’s pause for a moment to understand what Sam has done so far. He has listed the stationary and vehicle asset sources for NTO’s carbon accounting process and he has decoded the various emissions factors used for estimation of tCO₂e emissions for these assets. Next, he has created energy use records for stationary and vehicle assets, and he created the required carbon footprint records to aggregate the data. Sam has also looked at the calculations behind the scenes. He is now ready to uncover a few extra details about the carbon accounting process in the next unit.

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List the stages of carbon footprints.
                Explain record locking and carbon footprint recalculation.
                Explain why you need an annual carbon inventory record. 

            Carbon Footprint Stages

            A carbon footprint record is flexible in Net Zero Cloud. Companies can choose the reporting period for carbon footprints and how granular they want footprints to be. For example, Sam has the flexibility to create carbon footprint records that summarize emissions for a single asset for a given year, or for multiple assets across any period. NTO has chosen to create carbon footprints for each stationary and vehicle asset source for a single year.

            Sam notices that on all carbon footprint records there’s a field called the Footprint Stage. Carbon footprints for NTO go through a detailed process of approval and audit. All data is validated within Sam’s team and calculations are completed. Then, both internal and external audits are conducted to ensure that all emissions are correctly accounted for.

            Net Zero Cloud makes this process easy to manage. The Footprint Stage field comes with logical values that help Sam move the record through each stage with a simple click! Let’s take a closer look at these values and what they mean.

            Note

            The following picklist values are available by default for the Footprint Stage field on a carbon footprint record in Net Zero Cloud, but your admin can customize the stages as per company requirements.

                Emissions source confirmation: The user confirms whether to include an individual building or vehicle asset in the carbon footprint.
                Data collection: All energy consumption records are entered and associated with the assets.
                Validation: The user determines that the initial data looks correct, including the input and the calculated emissions output based on the associated emissions factors.
                Renewable energy allocation: The renewable energy allocation information is added to the energy consumption records.
                Internal audit: An internal auditor validates the energy consumption and carbon footprint information.
                External audit: An external auditor validates the carbon footprint information.
                Completed: The validated carbon footprint record is marked as complete. 

            The Footprint Stage picklist on a stationary asset carbon footprint record.

            The best part is that Sam can easily manage multiple carbon footprint records through their lifecycle using the Kanban view. This view makes the workflow better because Sam can visually track where each record is in the footprinting process. And when one stage is complete, he simply drags the record and drops it to the column of the next stage!

            Do More with Carbon Footprints

            The flexibility doesn’t end there. Sam explores a few additional features that make carbon accounting even easier with Net Zero Cloud.

            Lock the Carbon Footprint Record

            To ensure that the carbon footprint record is not updated accidentally or by an automated process, Sam locks the carbon footprint record, which also locks the child, or associated, energy use records. This prevents the carbon footprint record and all the energy use records associated with it from being recalculated. It also prevents accidental updates to the records during audits. Locked carbon footprint records can be unlocked later.

            Recalculate the Carbon Footprint

            The carbon footprint record can become out of sync with the energy use records that are associated with it, such as when emissions factors change or when the energy consumption numbers are updated in a child energy use record. If the emissions factors have changed for any associated energy use records, Sam can click Recalculate on a carbon footprint to reset and recalculate values from all attached energy use records. When a child energy use record is added or updated, Net Zero Cloud automatically recalculates all the child energy use records and the carbon footprint record. No manual updating and tracking needed!

            Note

            Sam can modify, lock, unlock, and recalculate carbon footprint records that he created. But if he wants to perform these actions on records that are created by other users, he must have Modify All permission on them. Sam can work with the Salesforce admin to gain the required permissions.
            Why Do You Need a Carbon Inventory?

            Sam now understands all the essentials of carbon accounting. Since all the work’s done and it’s the end of the year, Sam wants to give himself a pat on the back and a well-deserved break. But before that, he notices that there’s one last item left to be ticked off his to-do list. Sam can create an annual emissions inventory record for any given year to roll up all carbon footprints for all sources and activities. The aim for NTO is to set a science-based target and develop an emissions reduction target in line with Science-Based Targets Initiative’s (SBTi) criteria. The carbon inventory is the first step towards getting started on that path.

            On an annual emissions inventory record, Sam can see granular information for each emissions source type, broken up by category and activity and even the percentage of each emissions type towards the total emissions. Emissions from a Carbon Footprint record are aggregated into the annual emissions inventory if they meet the following conditions:

                The Reporting Year on a footprint record matches the Year that is selected during inventory creation.
                The Footprint Stage on a footprint record matches the Carbon Footprint Stage that is selected during inventory creation.
                The Annual Emissions Inventory on a footprint record is associated with an inventory record. 

            An annual emissions inventory record for 2021 showing total emissions by scope.

            Previously, Sam would have had to do all these calculations manually. That could have taken months! Salesforce Net Zero Cloud enables easy recording and traceability of calculated emissions. Moreover, Sam can also use this data to further forecast NTO’s emissions for upcoming years accurately. Sam can truly have a restful time-off!
            Sum It Up

            Salesforce Net Zero Cloud solves many of the issues with traditional carbon accounting: incomplete or missing records, manual data tracking in multiple spreadsheets, and unstructured data. The time it took NTO to collect, calculate, and audit data has been reduced from months to weeks.

            With all the data flowing directly onto one platform, Sam can efficiently quantify the carbon footprint across scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and reduce NTO’s carbon footprint, getting them closer to their net zero goal. Following in his footsteps, you too can formulate a climate action plan from a single source of truth, and easily measure and manage your plans with your trusted partner, the Net Zero Cloud.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain what digital engagement is.
                Describe key benefits of digital customer service.
                Identify the differences between digital service and digital transformation.

            What Is Digital Engagement?

            Ursa Major Solar’s business continues to grow. The company can’t keep enough solar panels in stock to sell to all its customers—and potential customers—who keep trying to contact them. But contacting Ursa Major Solar is difficult. At least that’s what Sita Nagappan-Alvarez, the CEO of Ursa Major Solar, keeps hearing. After a large deal closed with a residential builder, the client said, “If I could’ve reached you or learned about your business sooner, I would’ve bought twice as many panels...”

            Salesforce Research states, "As customers spend more time at home with their devices and less time in stores or places of work, the shift toward digital channels has accelerated. At the same time, the share of organizations offering in-person customer service plummeted, and channels such as online chat, messenger apps, and video support saw double-digit adoption gains. Eighty-seven percent of service professionals say customers have increased their use of digital channels during the pandemic." Gone are the days when an email or phone call is enough. To keep customers and potential customers happy, you must engage with them in the digital realm.

            Enter, digital engagement. It’s a term that describes how companies engage with customers across all digital touchpoints, while providing a consistent customer experience. Typically, a customer’s journey includes marketing, selling, and servicing in a way that lets them switch between multiple channels without interrupting a positive experience.

                A new campaign to promote solar panels on the web or on multiple social media channels (Marketing Cloud Engagement).
                Leads and opportunities from the campaign are captured and every stage of the deal is tracked and analyzed until the sale of the solar panel is complete (Sales Cloud & Commerce Cloud).
                After the solar panel is purchased, customers receive service reminders as texts on their mobile devices, review service agreements from a website, and reach out to support via chatbots, web chat, social media channels, and more (Service Cloud).

            Each part of the journey—no matter where the customer is at—is optimized with automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to make sure that a positive experience is delivered consistently.
            Digital Transformation

            Sita knows that emerging technology is transforming customers’ expectations. Customers ask virtual assistants to play their morning playlist, use applications to order their favorite foods, call for a ride, or navigate traffic. The reason these experiences are sticky is that emerging technologies like AI are embedded into these apps to power customer experiences. To stay competitive, companies need to incorporate digital technologies into their customer experiences.

            Customers expect to interact with businesses the same way they do in their personal lives—on mobile devices, with SMS messaging, social media, and more. If customers aren’t receiving the experiences they expect, they can easily take their business elsewhere. The rise of social media and review websites give customers more of a voice. In the past, customers might have shared a bad experience with friends and family, but with social media, they can broadcast bad experiences with the world.

            Digital transformation—converting ink-on-paper records to digital formats—encourages businesses to reconsider how to deliver customer experiences, and question traditional ideas of teams and departments. That doesn’t mean support agents need to run marketing campaigns, but it can mean knocking down walls between departments. A social media presence can encompass marketing, selling, and servicing, tied together by a digital platform that captures customer information, creates personalized journeys, and routes questions from customers or potential customers to the right support agents.
            Benefits of Digital Service

            Sita knows that digital transformation has reshaped how companies approach customer service. The old model was to wait for customers to find you, whether in person or by calling a toll-free number. But the rise of digital communication has changed service much like it’s changed advertising, media, and news.

            The practice of providing excellent service hasn’t changed. But the process of answering a question, looking up relevant data, and offering a solution has become much more efficient with mobile devices and multiple communication channels. Sita can see that embracing social media, automation, and AI will help build better relationships with new and existing customers.

                Offer customers the convenience of using messaging apps to communicate with your business, just like how they communicate with friends and family. Add SMS to your toll-free business number for messaging to appeal to mobile customers.
                Add a seamless support agent hand off by replacing static pre-chat forms with a simple chatbot experience to gather basic information from your customers. Or offer a chat experience directly from your mobile app.

            Free up agents with automation and AI to deliver better service
            	

                Identify areas where your customers and support agents spend the most time on repetitive tasks. Then, apply the power of automation and AI to deliver smarter experiences, which free up agents to solve bigger problems.
                Embed automation into service workflows with action lists and step-by-step guidance to make processes faster.
                Use AI to route work to the right agent, prefill case context, and make recommendations for next actions based on machine learning from past cases.


            Sita knows that she must move Ursa Major Solar into the realm of digital service. Based on the State of Service report from Salesforce, she understands that she’s not alone: 81% of decision-makers say they’re accelerating digital initiatives. But where to start? Enter Service Cloud.

            Engage Customers with Service Cloud
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain how Service Cloud helps with digital engagement.
                Describe key digital engagement options with Service Cloud.

            How Service Cloud Helps with Digital Engagement

            Even though each digital engagement journey for a customer includes marketing, selling, and servicing, Sita focuses on service. Based on the stats and feedback she’s received, transforming service for Ursa Major Solar is her number one priority.

            To get started with digital engagement for service, Sita turns to her rock star admin, Maria Jimenez. Maria has set up several Salesforce features for Ursa Major Solar, and she’s ready to share how Service Cloud can help with digital engagement.

             

            Sita and Maria standing alongside the Ursa Major Solar logo.

            First, since Salesforce is already in use, a number of digital engagement tools are available to set up. Maria may need to purchase a few new user or feature licenses, but everything she needs to help Ursa Major Solar engage and support customers in the digital realm is a few clicks away.

            Service Area
            	

            Description

            Service Cloud Platform
            	

                Provide a 360-degree view of customers and their past preferences from multiple channels. The platform includes agent productivity tools and routing features so customer cases automatically go to the right agent, at the right time, from anywhere, on any device.
                Push agents relevant knowledge from across your organization, including key articles, topics, and advice from your product experts.
                Allow agents to see customers’ histories to check on service agreements and to offer personalized incentives and special offers.

            Service Cloud Messaging
            	

                Let your company have conversations with customers in ways that are most convenient for them—on their mobile devices using messaging apps, such as SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger.
                Power conversations with chatbots to automate service or agents can connect instantly with a customer to give them the personalized help they might need.

            Service Cloud Embedded Service for Web or Mobile Apps
            	

                Embed customer service directly into your web pages and mobile apps so you can reach customers right where they are.
                Let your customers contact you on the go without interrupting their browsing experience or mobile experience.
                Add chat, knowledge, and case capabilities to your websites and mobile apps to provide richer service.

            Salesforce Self-Service
            	

                Build branded sites that let customers help themselves, anytime, on any device, without the assistance of an agent.
                Add self-service web portals to help customers connect with each other for insights, access knowledge, and interact with chatbots to find the right resources or get redirected to the right agent for immediate service.

            Service Cloud Einstein
            	

                Put artificial intelligence (AI) into routine service interactions, especially for chatbots on digital channels like web chat, SMS messaging, or voice activated devices.
                Connect chatbots to existing business process for more intelligent service automation.
                Save agents time by using machine learning to surface the best responses and knowledge from past cases and conversations. Let Einstein analyze incoming cases to automatically predict fields so that the right agents can handle specific requests faster.


            Sita is impressed with Service Cloud’s areas to support the digital realm. But she wonders where email and phone fits in. “Aren’t email and phones digital?” Maria assures her that email and telephone are traditional channels for service that often fall into the realm of digital engagement. Both email and telephony are part of multichannel service available with Service Cloud.
            Digital Engagement Options with Service Cloud

            Maria dives a little deeper into specific Service Cloud features and how they help with customer engagement. Learning about these features will help Sita and the service team decide what to implement.

            Service Area
            	

            Description

            Service Console
            	

                The Service Console is a centralized interface that lets agents see all relevant information about customers and helps them respond to cases across multiple channels, simultaneously.
                The console integrates with productivity tools, routing mechanisms, useful knowledge, predictive intelligence, data from other systems, and more to provide a unified workspace to support customers on any device, from any location, across any channel.
                All service features and channels connect with the console. And, since the console is a Lightning app, it’s easy to customize and scale with components and drag-and-drop tools.

            Salesforce Mobile app
            	

                Salesforce Mobile app is for customer service on the go, and it’s available on both iOS and Android devices.
                The app gives you real-time access to the same case and customer information that you see on the console but is organized for getting work done from your mobile device.

            Omni-Channel
            	

                Omni-Channel routes any type of incoming work item to the most qualified, available support agents in the console. Monitor agent workloads and the status of work items routed by Omni-Channel.
                Agents can raise flags on work items when they need assistance from a supervisor, and supervisors can monitor conversations between agents and customers, and send helpful messages that only the agent sees.
                Supervisors can also respond to incoming support requests by changing queues as needed and can update agent skills quickly.

            Voice & Call Center
            	

                Voice & Call Center integrates phone call capabilities with the console so that you can use your computer as a phone. Whenever a customer calls, their information appears front and center for agents so that they have everything they need to help the customer.
                No more time spent searching, scrolling, or clicking for information about a customer. Make outgoing calls directly from the console, and report on call outcome, duration, and more.

            Email-to-Case
            	

                Email-to-Case automatically converts emails sent to an address you specify to cases in the console.
                Email exchanges between customers and agents are tracked to see history and sentiment and lead to the quickest resolution.

            Web-to-Case
            	

                Web-to-Case lets you add a submission form on your website so that customers can submit cases directly to the console for agents.
                Since you choose the case fields on the form, any workflows, assignments, and responses are automatically triggered.

            Experience Cloud Sites
            	

                Sites help you share information and collaborate with customers, partners, or employees. Whether you call it a self-service web portal, a help forum, a support site, or something else, an online community lets your agents share approved content and connect with others from the console.
                Use easy point-and-click tools with Lightning templates to create branded collaboration spaces for various business purposes.

            Messaging
            	

                Messaging lets customers start conversations with your company by sending texts to your designated phone number or sending Facebook Messenger messages to your Facebook page. Incoming messages are displayed in the console, where agents can accept messages and start chatting.
                Agents can also proactively reach out to customers on these channels to keep them updated or use automation to send customers messages when Salesforce records change, such as when cases are closed.

            Embedded Service
            	

                Embedded Service helps you add personalized service to connected apps for mobile and the web. Create and monitor cases from any mobile device for a seamless service experience wherever your customers are located.
                Set up two-way audio chat for devices so that agents can have context for issues and solve problems directly from the console.

            Einstein Bots
            	

                Einstein Bots are applications that simulate human conversation, either aloud or from text message. Instead of having a conversation with an agent, customers can have a conversation with a computer integrated with an AI technology called Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
                Whether through typing or talking, a chatbot can connect with a customer to answer routine questions, leaving agents more time to help customers with more complex questions or problems.

            Einstein Case Classification
            	

                Einstein Case Classification uses predictive intelligence on new cases to recommend or populate picklist and checkbox field values based on past data. It uses machine learning, AI technology that determines the values on case fields, to free up time for support agents.
                More time for support agents means more time spent making customers happy and delivering exceptional experiences.


            A Service Console integrated with multiple channels alongside the Salesforce Mobile app.


            Now that Sita has a better idea of what digital service options are available with Service Cloud, she asks Maria to help her start planning for digital engagement.

            Plan for Digital Engagement
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Learn the importance of implementing case management before digital engagement.
                Begin the planning process for Service Cloud’s digital engagement tools.
                Understand the importance of content for digital engagement.

            Prepare for Digital Service

            Maria knows that adding multiple channels is the second stage of the general setup process for Service Cloud. (See the Service Cloud for Lightning Experience module for a refresher.)

            Service Cloud’s implementation process represented by concentric circles with an arrow pointed at the second circle, which is Channels.

            Maria understands why she shouldn’t set up channels or digital engagement first: If a customer reaches out for help, but there’s no consistent way to track, route, or respond to their question, who would receive the case to resolve? A customer or agent lost in an unclear case management process makes for an unhappy customer and agent.

            Maria is excited about setting up digital engagement features for service. Before she sets up any features, she asks Ursa Major Solar’s service team some questions about how they work. She wants a thousand-foot view into their general processes and requirements before she implements any specific features.

            Fundamentals

            Question
            	

            Answer

            Do your agents have a complete view of the customer?
            	

            Yes, during our case management implementation, we customized a Service Console to show account, contact, and other records for 360-degree views of customers. The console is ready to support multiple channels.

            Are you able to effectively route cases or messaging sessions to the right agents?
            	

            Yes, during our case management implementation, we set up some queues, assignment rules, and escalation rules, but we need to look into Omni-Channel.

            Omni-Channel routing sounds more robust and can automatically push and prioritize a variety of work to agents, without them picking items from a queue or determining priorities. We definitely need Omni-Channel for better automation and to scale the growth of our service team.

            Are you using automation to save time and speed case resolution?
            	

            We’re using some of the basic assignment and escalation rules.

            However, we’re not using anything like automated conversations with chatbots to answer routine questions online. We’re also not using any kind of AI or machine learning to make automatic field predictions to speed up case resolution. Someone needs to look into self-service, Einstein Bots, and Einstein Case Classification.

            Do your agents spend a significant amount of time switching between applications to get customer information or answers?
            	

            The console has made it easier for agents to see complete views of customers, but we need to do something about knowledge.

            We implemented Salesforce Knowledge, but we need to add the Knowledge component to the console so that automation suggests correct answers to agents while they’re working on cases.

            Self-Service

            Question
            	

            Answer

            Where can customers find answers to questions about your products or services? Can they access answers and information on a website or a mobile app?
            	

            Currently, we have a Web-to-Case form on our website where customers can submit cases. But that’s it. We’ve been wanting to update our website for a while, but we haven’t made the time.

            After reading about Experience Cloud sites, we need something like that online where customers, agents, and experts can collaborate and share ideas. We also need a source of truth for some documents about our solar panels. And adding a chatbot on an Experience Cloud site to answer common questions would help unload some of the most tedious work from our agents.

            Information for customers on a mobile app sounds great, but we need a site first, which everyone can access on mobile devices.

            Is there a business process—like registering a solar panel—that requires your customers to call an agent? Is there data that can only be accessed over the phone? How can you make this easier to access?
            	

            Unfortunately, to register solar panels, customers have to call an agent. Clearly, we need a web presence like an Experience Cloud site where customers can register any of our products online and do so at their own convenience.

            Also, since we implemented Salesforce Knowledge, we need to share some of our articles online so that customers can troubleshoot routine issues themselves, 24/7, without having to phone an agent during business hours.

            If you already have a knowledge base for your customers, are you using marketing automation to increase engagement and adoption of the portal?
            	

            Once we have a self-service site, and set up some social media channels, we will definitely look into message automation to drive traffic and awareness to it. Thank goodness we already have Salesforce Knowledge with some incredibly helpful articles that are ready to share online!

            	
            	

            Social Presence

            Question
            	

            Answer

            Do you receive service-related questions on social media? Are the right people responding?
            	

            We don’t know. We have no social media presence right now, at least none we’re participating in or responding to. We have to add a variety of social media channels to our digital engagement plans—we have to reach customers where they are at.

            Are customers chatting online about themes related to your product or industry?
            	

            Ryan De Lyon, our customer service manager, has heard some customers are posting questions about our solar panels on Twitter and Facebook. Since we are not monitoring those channels, we don’t really know what is going on there or how our brand is affected.

            Ideally, once we set up social channels, we’d like to contribute to conversations about the solar panel industry and lead a few talking points to build new relationships and drive more business.

            Are your customers already building online forums of their own to discuss your products or services?
            	

            We don’t know—we need to research this topic. A few months ago, one of our agents mentioned that there was a website displaying some of our solar panel manuals with a few comments posted on the site, but we’re not sure what that is about. Sounds like we need to look into it immediately.

            Messaging

            Question
            	

            Answer

            Where does most of your customer traffic come from? Is it from mobile or desktop?
            	

            We don’t know. We think that most of the people we interact with have mobile phones and use text messaging. Once we have some of our digital channels up and running, like self-service sites or social media, we should post a survey to our customers and try to determine how many of them prefer communicating with us from mobile devices or desktops.

            Do you know your percentage of customers using iPhones versus Android?
            	

            No, this is another area for a customer survey once we have digital channels set up. The answer will help us learn on which devices to build mobile service apps in the future.

            Are your customers using international messaging apps like WeChat or WhatsApp?
            	

            Currently, we don’t have any international customers. In the future, however, we hope to expand globally, so this question is important for us as we plan for growth.

            	
            	

            Automation & AI

            Question
            	

            Answer

            Do your agents spend time on data entry or repeating steps on every case that they work?
            	

            Our agents do type a lot of the same things in the console, but we’re already looking into the console’s Macros and Quick Text features to reduce repetitive tasks.

            Macros will help agents select email templates, send emails, and change case statuses all with one click, whereas Quick Text will help agents send a variety of predefined messages to customers so they save time typing the same responses, no matter which channel.

            Do you have a list of the top common questions, such as order status or password reset that you get from customers on a regular basis?
            	

            Yes, our agents spend a lot of time answering similar questions, especially on order statuses. If we had a self-service site or a text messaging channel where Einstein Bots could answer those questions, our agents could focus on solving more complex issues that require creativity and teamwork.

            Do you have any picklist or checkbox fields on cases that machine learning could prefill for agents; any recommendations for knowledge articles or next actions for agents?
            	

            Yes, some useful fields to predict are Case Reason, Escalated, and Priority—having those automatically predicted would save agents time and clicks. And, anytime a useful article from our knowledge base could surface to an agent without searching for it is a productivity boost. Also, any kind of AI that suggests next-best actions for agents while they work would be a dream come true. Offloading some decisions during customer interactions could only help agents focus on building better relationships.
            Digital Content Considerations

            As Maria plans for digital engagement, she sees a unique thread that ties a number of features together—content. She wonders, “Do we have the right content ready to help agents and customers across multiple channels?” Based on the answers to the planning questions above, she knows the answer is no.

            Traditionally, content is something only marketers, advertisers, or media agencies created. Support agents worked with a limited content choice of case open or case closed. If service teams created content, it was usually a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page on a website. With chatbots, SMS messaging, social media posts, or conversational interfaces from buttons all the way to online payments, content is a big piece of how to deliver service. Content is also a critical component for closing the loop on marketing, selling, and servicing. Content creation and curation requires a new set of skills for service. The teams at Ursa Major Solar will have to give considerable thought to the content that appears in each stage of a basic digital customer journey.
            Next Steps for Digital Engagement

            Now that Sita and Maria have answers to their questions, they take a step back to prioritize Service Cloud feature implementations. There are a lot of features they can set up, so they ask themselves a few more high-level questions.

                Which channel should we set up first, second, and so on?
                Are our agents trained to communicate on those channels?
                Will agents cover all channels or will some agents cover specific channels?
                Will the channel take into account international customers and multiple languages?
                Are our console and case management processes ready to support each new channel and automation or AI?

            All of these questions should be asked before adding a new digital channel to a multichannel support model. Once Maria gets the answers she’s looking for, she can begin setting up specific service features for Ursa Major Solar. It looks like there’s a lot more Trailhead in Maria’s future.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Define Web3.
                Describe each evolution of the internet.
                Describe why Web3 is important for the future.

            Welcome to the World Wide Web

            A lot has changed since the advent of the internet in the early 1990s... The internet is alive. It’s an ever-changing technology that has become our default context. And as the internet has evolved—from a way to link documents to an accessible information system to an interconnected social network with millions of active users daily—the way we relate to each other and the world around us has changed. 

            Since its advent, the internet has enabled billions of users worldwide to learn, share, and connect globally for free. But millions of people can share and manipulate all of the information out there. This creates the enormous gaps in transparency, privacy, and security we experience with today’s internet ecosystem. This problem can theoretically be solved with the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0, often referred to as Web3. 

            How we connect with our friends, family, and coworkers has drastically shifted since the early ’90s, taking us from in-person to virtual, making the digital world more central to our everyday lives. We’re now seeing a new digital economy emerging with users at the center. Many believe we’re entering the next era, where the emerging technology and use cases we see today will continue to evolve and be played out over years and decades.

            There’s a lot to unpack here. That’s why we created this module: to help make sense of where we’ve been, where we’re headed next, and what it all means.

            Before we get to the details about Web3, let’s review some basics. Let’s start from the beginning. 
            The Evolution of the Internet

            The evolution of the web is often divided into three stages: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0. 

            In the beginning, Web1 (1990 to 2000) democratized access to information. It was the first iteration of the world wide web. Most of us were consumers of content. And the creators were typically developers who built websites that contained information mainly in text or image format. Data and content were served from a static file system rather than a database, and sites didn’t have much interactivity at all. It was the Web of Read.

            Most of us have experienced the wonders of the web in its current form, which is referred to as Web2 (2000 to 2021). This stage of the internet took Web1 further by democratizing connections and transactions. In this era, the simplicity built into the interfaces and applications enabled anyone to become a creator. It’s the Web of Read and Write.

            As we experience the beginning of the Web3 era (2021 and beyond), applications will not run on a single server or store data in a single database owned by central authorities. Instead, Web3 applications will either run on blockchains, decentralized networks of many peer-to-peer servers (nodes), or a combination of the two. Web3 has the potential to democratize participation on the internet, enabling people to Read, Write, and Own both their data and digital identity.

            Why Web3 Matters

            Web3 is a point of evolution beyond where we have been operating. It’s an extension of Web2, which incorporates the advanced technologies we see coming to fruition today. The idea of Web3 is not only to fuel the formation of the metaverse and expansion of cryptocurrency, but to touch on other major industries in our globally interconnected world. The ultimate goal of Web3 is to create a more connected and open digital world.

            Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities will not decide who uses what services. Nor is there a need for an intermediary to facilitate virtual transactions between parties. Web3 theoretically better protects user privacy in certain ways because it’s these authorities and go-betweens in Web2 doing most of the data collection. 

            There are a number of advantages that Web3 has the potential to offer.

                Decentralization: Intermediaries would be removed from the equation, and blockchains would provide a transparent platform where the rules are unbreakable and data is publicly recorded.
                Ownership of data: End users will regain control of data by creating a public record of all their activity on the blockchain. Information could then be shared on a case-by-case and permissioned basis.
                Potential for reduction in hacks and data breaches: As more businesses and enterprises enter the space, there will be a large need for added security. This new technology can provide enhanced security because data will be decentralized and distributed. With further development of the rules and regulations, there is potential for reduction in large-scale hacks and data breaches where hackers would need to turn off the entire network of servers and record every transaction on the blockchain to access information.
                Permissionless blockchains: Anyone could create an address and interact with the network. Users will not be barred on account of geography, income, gender, orientation, or a host of other sociological and demographic factors.

            While still in its early years, the mission behind Web3 is to create a decentralized web that creates new types of ownership, new ways of building trust and collaboration, and opens the doors to new possibilities. It has the potential to change how we interact with the web in the upcoming decades. Web3 is built on blockchain technology that validates user data, creates transaction transparency, and provides more secure payment options. 
            Where Do We Go Next?

            The future is a decentralized, global marketplace. In the next unit, discover how Web3 is transforming industries and impacting businesses, society, and individuals alike.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe main components of Web3.
                Define NFT, blockchain, and cryptocurrency.

            The Building Blocks of Web3: Blockchain

            In today’s digital-first world, someone can buy a tweet, develop digital land, pay without a traditional currency, and track down data to the 1s and 0s, all from the comfort of their personal device. The innovative technology that enables this transparency is the blockchain. 

            A blockchain is a system of recording information on a tamper-resistant digital ledger distributed across its entire network of computer systems. Each block on the chain contains transaction data that records each transaction on participants’ ledgers. The transactions are public and cannot be changed, tampered with, or erased once published. 

            The idea of a blockchain came to life as a solution for accurate and fixed time stamps, similar to that of a notary. This fundamental aspect is still present in technology today. 

            Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology (DLT), where these transactions are programmable, immutable, and anonymous. 

            Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that is programmable, anonymous, unanimous, distributed, immutable, and traceable.

            Blockchains are constantly growing as blocks (transactions recording verified information) are added to the chain through every transaction. This increases the security of the entire ledger. The more blocks on the chain, the more secure the entire system becomes. This also allows regulators to easily identify if one of the blocks was tampered with, making hacking nearly impossible. 

            This is a young sector, and norms and standards are still emerging, including key issues such as sustainability. Companies, including Salesforce, have an opportunity to lead with values, and shape positive norms and benchmarks for using NFT and blockchain technology sustainably.

            One key challenge in this space is related to sustainability. Many of the first generation cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin) rely on proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, which require the use of energy (that is, work) to perform transactions. This has resulted in significant energy consumption and carbon emissions, with Bitcoin consuming as much power per year as the country of Thailand (as of February 2022), according to the Digiconomist.

            The industry is continuing to address sustainability issues as their technology evolves, as we’re seeing with new and upcoming proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Based on current models, it’s believed that PoS blockchains drastically reduce the energy consumption seen by current-state PoW blockchains (by as much as 99.95% according to Olga Kharif’s Bye-Bye, Miners! How Ethereum’s Big Change Will Work, which appeared on Bloomberg.com in 2021). Additionally, e-waste from PoW blockchain use may be eliminated by switching to PoS, which does not rely on physical hardware for securing the network.

            Companies and organizations exploring blockchain applications should put in place clear sustainability strategies to quantify, minimize, neutralize, and disclose environmental impacts resulting in net zero emissions while driving increased sustainability in the sector more broadly.

            Now that we’ve discussed the power, purpose, and impact of Web3, let’s look at how this technology is utilized in cryptocurrencies. 
            What Makes a Currency a Cryptocurrency?

            The simple answer is that a cryptocurrency is a nontraditional digital currency built on the blockchain. To expand on this, let’s look at how cryptocurrencies came to be. 

            On October 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto sent a paper to a group of cryptographers familiar with blockchain technology outlining a new form of “electronic cash” called Bitcoin. In this paper he outlined how the distributed ledger technology (DLT) was combined with several other technologies and concepts to create the cryptocurrencies of today. These digital currencies are essentially electronic cash protected through cryptographic mechanisms instead of a central authority like a bank, company, or government. 

            Blockchain technology is the foundation of modern cryptocurrencies, most commonly referred to as crypto. They got their name because of the heavy usage of cryptographic functions paired with the decentralized ledgers. 

            This system allows someone to purchase, trade, and own a variety of things, including NFTs and real estate. And with more integration into our financial system, many more applications can be expected. 

            Next, let’s explore the role of NFTs in the Web3 ecosystem. 
            What Is an NFT?

            An NFT (nonfungible token) is a digital asset that represents either digital or physical objects like art, music, event tickets, videos, and more. They’re backed by smart contracts, which allows them to have distinctive properties such as secondary sales and transferable value. 

            Here’s how NFTs work.

                NFTs exist on a blockchain, which is a distributed public ledger that records transactions.
                NFTs are blockchain agnostic, meaning they can be built on a variety of blockchains.
                An NFT is created, or “minted” from digital objects that can represent both tangible and intangible items.
                An NFT can have only one owner at a time, and an NFT’s unique data makes it easy to verify the creator and owner, and enables token transfer between owners.
                The creator writes a smart contract that defines the use and royalties of the NFT.

            The Value of NFTs

            So why buy an NFT, since anyone can copy an image or a video with an internet search and a few clicks? Well, buying an NFT gives proof of ownership of a unique digital asset, which can include virtual goods, in-game items, digital art, and more. Because they are built on the blockchain, the transaction and ownership history is public. This information is validated and records authenticity of the seller and the sole ownership. Just like with a physical asset, this can be collected, traded, or sold. In the case of digital art or when purchasing NFTs in secondary marketplaces, buyers should follow best practices to avoid potential scams and other risks. (More on this in a later unit.)

            This technology enables trust and transparency between the buyer and seller by having full access to the historical transactions. The transparency provided by the public records can give the buyer insight into the seller's transaction history. As this technology develops, we’ll see companies creating products that will verify a seller or provide a risk rating based on past digital interactions. 

            Anyone can search online and find an image, video, or NFT for that matter, and download it to a device. But that’s just saving a copy of the file, not obtaining rights to the digital ownership of the file. For example, there are a lot of copies of Van Gogh’s Starry Night painting, but there’s only one original Starry Night. In theory, NFTs offer collectors the ability to own the digital rights to a piece of art, similar to owning the original Starry Night. (Note: This does not account for creators who copy and repost the original artist’s work as their own. These artists are infringing on copyright and can face serious penalties.)

            Brand-new experiences are being built around rare digital and physical goods through the use of NFTs. Given that any digital thing can be an NFT, there are several possible use cases. Some companies have already capitalized on this idea, doing things such as launching an NFT system to verify the authenticity of sneakers, or creating NFTs from video clips of landmark sports moments so fans can own the best plays.

            To demonstrate NFTs’ utility, here are a few more use cases. We may continue to see more as time and technology progress.

                Gaming asset: NFTs can be used as characters in video games and possess gamification capabilities. For example, games have allowed players to purchase NFTs that serve as their game avatars. And as players play, they can earn more NFTs, such as an ultra-rare shield to help them in battle or a new accessory to deck out their avatar.
                Key: NFTs can act as key to unlocking content, like a subscription to a sports or news magazine. Only the holders of the NFT are able to access the articles, updates, and statistics in the publication.
                Digital twin: NFTs can be purely digital; however, some projects have allowed the creation of digital twins. This can be something like offering virtual clothes that can be worn in the metaverse or sending an identical physical object to NFT owners.
                IP ownership: Projects can allow members to own the intellectual property of their NFT. The owner doesn't have to ask the NFT creator to use their avatar—they have the ability to create an entire business around the NFT.
                Governance/voting: NFTs can give owners voting rights on upcoming promotional merchandise and new platform/product releases, among other things.

            NFTs can create authenticity, establish value, democratize access to global markets, and build community. Let’s take a deeper look at how NFTs use smart contracts and wallets. 
            Smart Contracts and Wallets

            How does someone actually use cryptocurrency to buy an NFT? Let’s start by understanding how these transactions are tracked with smart contracts and how users employ wallets to buy and hold onto their NFTs.

            First let’s go over a few NFT-related terms. 

            Smart contracts: These are simply computer programs (a few lines of code), stored on a blockchain, that run when predetermined conditions are met. They can be viewed as an application of Web3. They’re typically used to automate the execution of an agreement (or contract), so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action, when certain conditions are met.

            Wallets: A wallet is an app (or plugin), which enables users to access/retrieve, send, and receive digital assets. When a user acquires cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, they can store it in a wallet and from there use it to make transactions. There are two types of wallets.

                A custodial wallet is one created and secured by someone other than the true owner—for example, an account set up on Coinbase.
                A noncustodial wallet is one consumers create, own, and manage themselves. They often live directly within browsers (hot) or on offline devices (cold storage). Users self-manage security.

            Smart contracts are used to protect buyers and sellers with automated contracts that are programmed to execute when certain conditions are met. These agreements can’t be changed or disputed once executed because smart contracts are immutable, distributed, and public. 

            With the ability to track when and to whom all NFTs are sold, smart contracts make purchasing NFTs at scale possible. This creates many possibilities, like enabling royalties for the original creator of an NFT, and offering protection for buyers.

            To actually purchase an NFT, a buyer needs a wallet. There are many kinds of wallets, both custodial and noncustodial, each with pros and cons. Metamask, for example, is a noncustodial, browser-based wallet that’s currently the most popular to use with OpenSea, a popular NFT marketplace. With the rising popularity of NFTs and marketplaces, buyers should look into which wallet fits their needs best for security, ease of use, and compatibility with their marketplace of choice. 

            Wallets enable new capabilities for brands and users to interact. A few new possibilities include: 

                New identity: Users may connect to a site and then provide access to any relevant information they want to share with the company for personalization. This provides a key to access the data, rather than sharing it.
                New experiences: In the near future, users may be able to have a wide range of assets in their wallets, essentially creating virtual versions of themselves. These 3D representations will allow them to try clothes on in real time and see the fit on their virtual selves.
                New ways to sign in: In the future, users may use NFTs on sites rather than passwords. Held in wallets, the NFTs will grant access without the need to remember passwords or have personal information stored in a brand’s network.

            Now that you’ve learned about blockchain, crypto, and NFTs, let’s explore how all of these technologies can come together in the metaverse to create distinct digital experiences made possible through the engagement and participation of the evolving Web3 community.

            Build Community in Web3
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe and define the metaverse.
                Describe main components of the Web3 community.
                Explain the utility of DAOs and dApps in building community

            Where Worlds Collide: The Metaverse

            As we’ve discussed, we’re in the early days of a new version of the internet called Web3. It’s being built on trusted, decentralized technology accessible to all. Platforms, apps, and data won't belong to large platforms—they’ll belong to users. 

            Some people are calling this new internet the metaverse. The metaverse is a new reality that reimagines how we interact with the world around us. Playing Fortnite or roaming around Roblox are great examples of Web2 metaverses, the difference is that the Web3 metaverse is backed by the chain. 

            The terms metaverse and Web3 have been used interchangeably, but they have inherent differences. According to Oxford Languages, the metaverse is “a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.” Users will only be able to jump between digital worlds with ownership of their assets intact if the metaverse is operating on a decentralized platform. 

            Web3 enables a more equitable metaverse, allowing for true ownership (and interoperability) across many metaverses/gamescapes and virtual realities. For example, a sword bought for one game could now be used in another.

            The metaverse is where the Web3 community comes together to connect, learn, game, and engage with people around the world. 
            Community Comes First

            Community and collaboration is central to Web3, providing a foundation that improves the likelihood of success and maintains relevance of a project, idea, event, and so forth. 

            The strength of an online community’s network is not only determined by how many people make up the community, but also the participants’ engagement on social media and community discussion forums. The decentralized nature of blockchain emphasizes the importance of community as a pillar of the next generation of internet. 

            So where are these communities if everything is decentralized? The short answer is, they’re everywhere around the world. They’re communicating via messaging platforms and social media, and organizing live events to attend together. Having tremendous reach and engagement across Discord, Twitter, and Telegram, these communities of diverse individuals are able to have a real impact. Since the foundation of these communities are messaging based, users are more engaged with content on the platform and have deeper connection to the people and content. They’re participants rather than simply users.

            One way communities come together in Web3 is through DAOs and dApps. Keep reading to learn about these two functions of Web3. 
            Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

            A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is a group or collective made up of individuals who organize around a common purpose. They’re managed by smart contracts, powered by tokens, have a shared treasury, and are governed by community voting. Examples range from the development of open-source software to a crowd-sourced attempt at purchasing the US Constitution. 

            DAOs are to Web3 what open-source projects are to Web1. DAOs are made up of people who share common goals and objectives, visions, and values. These groups unite to produce products or deliver services, and members/contributors are rewarded for their contributions to the collective.

            DAOs represent a framework for community and shared responsibility—what companies represent in the context of Web2. This framework might very well function as the underpinning for the future of work (the next era of the gig economy).
            Decentralized Apps (dApps)

            Next, we have decentralized apps (dApps), which are applications (software), built on a decentralized network (blockchain), which combine a smart contract and a front-end (UI). dApps use the same front end as Web2 apps, but rely on blockchain technology rather than centralized servers or other centralized databases. 

            Web2 applications like Instagram or Twitter differ from Web3 applications in that they’re owned/operated by centralized authorities (for example, companies like Meta). 

            In the case of Web3 applications, no central authority or governing body has absolute control or governance rights when it comes to data recorded on/by the network. Instead, the data is verified by a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers.

            In the future, we can expect that media, gaming, and finance industries will see a significant shift toward dApps, as they provide greater ownership for creators, enable play-to-earn, and create faster and more secure transactions.
            Bringing It All Together

            Each of these technologies—blockchain, cryptocurrencies, metaverses, DAOs, dApps—are paving the way for significant changes in our personal and work lives. But it’s the combination of these technologies that provides the foundation for Web3. 

            We can easily imagine a bright and shiny future powered by the increasing use cases and applications of blockchain technologies, but if we’re not careful, these can be a destabilizing force for society. 

            The same way that the two previous internet revolutions had positive and negative impacts, new technologies in Web3 carry potentially negative repercussions. Putting the control in the wrong hands can alter our future in undesirable ways if the goals are not aligned with the common good. 

            It’s a new era. Governments, business leaders, the scientific community, and citizens need to work together to define the paths, lead with values, and direct the technologies of Web3 to create sustainable applications and a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive society. Read on to learn more about approaching Web3 with ethics, trust, and safety at the forefront.

            Learn About Trust and Safety in Web3
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Articulate the ethical principles for Salesforce’s Web3 product innovation.
                Identify potential downsides and risks in Web3.
                Identify strategies and best practices for keeping safe and secure in the Web3 space. 

            Background

            Blockchain, cryptocurrency, and NFTs are driving innovation and commerce at scale. As with any early stage technology, potential outcomes can be unknown. Which is why it’s critical for those innovating in this space to do so in a responsible, ethical way. If we want Web3 to improve the lives of everyone within the ecosystem, not just a handful of people at the top, we need to design it in a values-led way. 

            Principles-Led Product Innovation

            At Salesforce, we believe that products in the Web3 space should be created with these principles in mind.

                Trust and Security. We will embed best-in-class brand and consumer protections, identifying—and preventing the use of the product for—fraud, force, or fear.
                Sustainability. We commit to quantify, disclose, minimize, and neutralize environmental impacts resulting in net zero emissions while driving increased sustainability in the sector more broadly.
                Equality. We will provide guidance and guardrails to ensure fairness, diversity, and empowerment of customers and consumers.
                Accountability. We will empower the end-user with explainable governance and engage stakeholders in ongoing evaluation.
                Integrity and Transparency. We commit to share clear, precise communication about the product and create trusted experiences and marketplaces where safety is top of mind. 

            We believe that by leading with our values, we can help guide this new space in a positive direction.
            The Challenges of an Emerging Web3 Landscape

            While there is much to be excited about when it comes to Web3, there’s also reason to proceed with a degree of caution as the space grows and matures. Here are some of the known and potential risks within the ecosystem. 

            Speculative Bubbles

            The Dutch tulip mania from 1634 to 1637 is the classic example of a significant difference between the financial value of an asset and its intrinsic value. It created a speculative bubble, which saw the price of tulips reach incredibly high levels. There have been many such bubbles since, and some claim that Web3 is in such a moment.

            Price Volatility

            Assets in Web3 are susceptible to price volatility, since Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be argued to have no intrinsic value. And unlike other traditional currencies, they aren’t backed by a government or central bank. As a result, their price is driven only by supply and demand. As their value increases, this success may attract new investors, sending prices upward. On the flip side, a negative event or even a tweet can drive prices downward.

            Lack of Diversity

            NFTs sit at the intersection of two historically white and male dominated industries: visual art and crypto. The bulk of NFT sales—roughly 77%—are flowing to male creators while only 5% of sales go to female artists. Similarly, it’s posited that the average NFT purchaser is a 38-year-old male who makes over $100,000/year. This poses an issue for promoting equality and inclusion. If most of the NFT community is male and white, there is market pressure to create NFTs that mirror this population and create barriers to entry for nonwhite, nonmale folks to get involved in the space. 

            Lack of Privacy

            One of the benefits of cryptocurrency is it allows for anonymity. Connecting one’s identity to a wallet is optional, and many people prefer to keep their cryptocurrency wallet address private for good reason. Imagine if, when you sent digital payment to a lunch partner for your half of the meal, they could now see every other transaction you’d ever made—and not just on that platform, but the ones you made with your credit card, bank transfer, or other apps, and with no option to set the visibility of the transfers to “private.” 

            Immutability

            Another feature of blockchains is their immutability: Once data is written to the blockchain, it’s there forever. While this has many useful applications, such as for storing transaction records, it can be a challenge for user-created data, particularly when considering online abuse and harassment. If someone stores harmful, inflammatory or hateful material on a blockchain, it cannot be removed. The platforms might be petitioned to hide the content, but the offensive content would still remain on the chain.

            Lack of Third-Party Protection

            Third-party intermediaries, like banks or credit unions, play a critical role in safeguarding customers’ interests. Banks, for example, have ways of detecting activity by malicious actors, and consumers can challenge fraudulent transactions on their credit cards. When transactions take place without a third party, customers have no one to whom they can appeal for help. For example, if someone loses their private key—which functions like a password—then owners can no longer access their wallets, with no recourse. In January 2021, The New York Times reported that $140 billion worth of bitcoin is locked in wallets whose private keys have been lost or forgotten.
            The Early Days of Regulation

            Today, cryptocurrencies and NFTs are largely exempt from legal and financial regulation, which means there is little or no protection for those who create, invest, or trade in them. 

            For example:

            Data Hosting and Storage: An NFT and the digital asset it represents are usually stored separately. The NFT is stored on the blockchain and contains information about where the digital asset is located, but the NFT could be deleted or the server hosting it could fail or be hacked. This would make the NFT worth little or nothing—and the law has not yet addressed what rights the NFT owner would have in such a situation.

            Data Protection: NFTs may contain personal information that is subject to data protection laws. Some of these laws—like GDPR (the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation)—allow individuals to erase or amend their personal data. However, NFTs are linked to the blockchain, where that is impossible (immutability!). These issues of security and data sharing for NFTs have so far received little consideration.

            Intellectual Property Rights: The buyer of an NFT may erroneously think they own the actual art associated with the NFT. In reality, the only person with the right to copy, distribute, alter, or publicly display the art is its original creator. There is the possibility that a disgruntled NFT buyer may bring legal action if they feel that there was misrepresentation when they were sold the NFT, as they believed they were buying the copyright.

            Taxation: The US and other nations have little or no legislation in this regard, nor any official advice relating to NFTs and tax. While it can be expected that profits and losses relating to NFTs would be liable for capital gains tax, and that the NFTs themselves would be considered assets for the purposes of other taxes—including inheritance tax—the official position has yet to be confirmed.
            Safety and Security in Web3

            Beyond the dynamics noted, there are a number of scams and frauds that are perpetrated in the NFT space, and it’s useful to be able to recognize and avoid them. Here are the six most common.

            Type
            	

            Description

            Rug pull
            	

            The originators of a crypto project take the capital raised from a token sale and disappear.

            Pump and dump
            	

            A particular crypto asset is hyped, leading to a short-term spike in the asset’s price as buy orders flood in. The instigators then sell off their holdings, triggering a crash, with other investors left “holding the bag.”

            Wash trading
            	

            The price of a crypto asset is artificially inflated by repeatedly trading it between wallets controlled by the same individual or group.

            Ponzi scheme
            	

            Capital from later investors in a crypto asset is used to pay returns to earlier investors.

            Hacking
            	

            Protocols or wallets are hacked and owners’ crypto assets stolen.

            Phishing
            	

            Attackers use social engineering techniques to trick a target into revealing information that can be used to gain access to their crypto assets.
            Ways to Protect Yourself

            How to Spot a Scam

            As a user, the first step of prevention is to keep your eyes peeled for potential signs of scams. Here’s how to recognize some common, dubious tactics. 

                Phishing: Users get a seemingly legitimate email from a platform or exchange they frequently use, with a malicious link embedded that lures them to make a transaction. Or it may even inject malware that scans for seed phrases stored in laptops.
                Hacking: Hackers sometimes airdrop malicious NFTs to user accounts as a Trojan Horse. Interacting with these malicious NFT airdrops prompt the user to sign a message that allows hackers to gain access and drain the account.
                FOMO: A cool new project comes up with a timer counting down on the purchase page, inducing serious FOMO (fear of missing out). When the user signs the transaction and makes that purchase, hackers obtain access to their wallets. Unknown to the user, the purchase page was linked to a scam URL. 

            Protect Your Seed Phrase and Secure Your Device

            A seed phrase is a group of words that are used to restore a crypto wallet. A seed phrase looks like this:

            rebuild-glow-language-lady-mushroom-poverty-episode-slow-meat-analyst-knee-output-oblige-couch-tilt 

            It’s very important to keep this phrase private and secure, since anyone with your seed phrase can use it to take over your wallet.

            This is where hackers come in and use various methods, including social engineering, to try and steal your seed phrase. One form of this is a scam where they pretend to be support staff from a marketplace or crypto business and ask for your details like your seed phrase or Metamask recovery QR code. Even experienced crypto-natives have fallen for these types of scams. Whenever someone asks you for this information, it should immediately set off alarm bells in your head. 

            Whatever type of wallet you use, take caution and practice a security-conscious approach to keeping your device and browser clear of any potential malware. This includes doing due diligence on websites you interact with, keeping your software up-to-date with security patches, and ignoring emails, links, or DMs from strangers.
            Best Practices

            Now that you’re aware of potential risks, let’s discuss how to mitigate them! Here are our overall best practices for staying safe in the new Web3 reality.

                Always visit the original website—a trusted, first-party marketplace—for any sale or offer.
                Only download applications and software from the originating source.
                If you’re using them, disable direct messages on Telegram and Discord from people who are not on your friends list.
                Never click any link sent to you from an unverified source without properly checking it.
                Never send your seed phrase to anyone.
                Never open an email link that looks suspicious.
                Never install any file with a “.exe” or “.scr” extension sent to you by an unknown sender.
                Never fill your wallet password and seed phrase into any form that you are not sure of.
                Store your cryptocurrency in a cold wallet or have multiple wallets (separating your daily use wallet from the wallet where you keep the bulk of your funds).
                Generate your keys securely—on a newly reset, offline device if possible.
                Keep your device, such as mobile phone or desktop, clear of malware and update frequently to the latest security patch.
                Make sure you interact only with audited smart contracts.
                Disconnect your wallet after every transaction.
                Be vigilant—always double-check your transactions, recipient addresses, and browser URL.
                Use common sense and trust your intuition—if something seems too good to be true, well, it just might be.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain the importance of data privacy.
                Describe how privacy laws apply to your organization.
                Outline customer expectations regarding privacy. 

            Privacy Introduction

            As a security professional, it’s important to stay informed of the latest privacy laws that apply to your organization, especially if your organization handles customers’ personal data. Why is this so important? Ensuring your customer and employee data is protected is paramount to establishing and maintaining trust. In this module we’re going to review the tools for implementing an effective privacy program.

            If your organization stores and processes customer data, your customers trust you to protect, use, and process their data securely, in accordance with applicable laws. This data can include personal data such as contact, healthcare, or financial information, or business-related information such as expenditures, marketing, or analytics data.

            Regardless of what type of data you process or store, it’s important to keep it safe. In addition to processing or storing customer data, your organization is accountable for its own data, including knowledge about prospective customers, employee information, financial data, and more.

            So how do you ensure this data is protected? For starters, you should be aware of and follow applicable privacy laws. We get into the details of these privacy laws here. To document compliance with applicable privacy laws and protect yourself and your customers, it’s a good idea to have agreements in place when you’re collecting customer data. These agreements should detail how your organization will keep customer data secure and confidential. As an example, most international airlines are required to attest on their public websites to how they protect a customer’s privacy, what data they collect, and why and how it’s collected, used, assessed, safeguarded, and stored.
            Why Privacy Matters

            Let’s step back for a moment and review the concept of privacy and what it means. Privacy relates to how a piece of information—or data— should be managed and protected based on its relative importance.

            Data privacy has become a hot topic lately due to lapses in security and concerns about how companies are using the customer data they collect. Data privacy concerns are particularly important for companies in certain sectors such as finance and healthcare. These sectors contain sensitive information and are typically highly regulated. They also are increasingly targeted by cyberattacks, which if successful may result in not only loss of this data, but also loss of confidence by consumers. 

            Let’s look at an example. When you apply for a credit card, you’re typically required to provide your legal name, birthdate, address, government-issued identification number, and annual income. That’s a lot of information! Not only is this information used to verify your identity, but it also allows the credit card company to check your credit history. This information is considered your personal data, and the credit card company is required to put security measures in place to protect it.

            In this example, privacy means that the credit card company is responsible for protecting your personal information against unauthorized disclosure, that they’re transparent about how they use your personal data, that they use the data in accordance with applicable laws, and that you agree to the use of your data for a certain purpose.

            Privacy Terminology

            Before we dive deeper into privacy laws, let’s review some basic definitions.

            Customer data: The information a customer provides while interacting with a business whether via a website, mobile application, social media, and more.

            Data subject: An individual whose personal data is collected, held, or processed.

            Personal data: The data that is directly attributable to a data subject and can identify an individual such as a name, home address, or personal identifier (for example, passport number).

            Sensitive personal data: Some types of personal data are considered sensitive and are subject to stricter regulation. This may include data about race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health, or data concerning a person's sex life or sexual orientation.

            Processing: Any operation or set of operations on data (for example, access, collection, recording, retrieval, copying, storage, disclosure, dissemination, and so on).

            Controller: An individual or entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.

            Processor: An individual or entity that processes personal data on behalf of a controller.

            Custodian (or handler): The individual responsible for the safe custody, transport, and storage of the data, and implementation of business rules. 

            Data Protection Authority (DPA): National authorities tasked with the protection of data and privacy as well as monitoring and enforcement of the data protection regulations within the Union.

            Your organization can act as both a processor and a controller, depending on the situation and the data involved. It’s helpful to think of the roles of processor and controller in relation to the allocation of responsibilities between parties. Your customers can be both controllers and processors. However, your organization always acts as a processor when a customer submits data to you and as controller when you determine the means and purposes of processing the data.
            Privacy Laws

            Depending on where your organization operates, you may need to adhere to location-specific privacy laws. If your organization operates globally, it’s important to implement policy requirements applicable to the country of operation. For example, if your organization operates in Japan, you are subject to the Act on the Protection of Personal Information.

            Privacy laws exist to protect individuals with respect to their personal data. They also regulate how personal data can and cannot be used. Let’s take a closer look at what privacy laws address.

                Whether personal data can be collected and processed
                What and how information should be provided around data processing practices
                Who can access and use the personal data
                How personal data can be processed
                How the data should be secured
                When to delete or amend the data
                Who is allowed to transport or have custody of the data
                Where and how personal data can be transferred to other countries
                How security incidents are handled
                What rights data subjects have regarding their personal data 

            Globally, there are two types of privacy laws: comprehensive (applicable to all industries and sectors) and sectoral (applicable to specific industries or sectors). In the US, the federal government has historically taken a sectoral approach. For example, there’s the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which is the US healthcare privacy law protecting data that reveals the health status of an individual (called protected health information or PHI). 

            The only US national privacy law that exists is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which regulates how online companies can collect and use data on children under the age of 13. 

            In the absence of a comprehensive national privacy law, several states have taken the initiative to  enact their own privacy legislation, including:

                California - California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
                Virginia - Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)
                Connecticut - Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA)
                Utah - Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA)
                Colorado - Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) 

            These states have either recently passed their own privacy legislation or are in the process of legislation. And many more states are considering doing the same. By passing their own privacy laws, these states provide their own protection for their constituents.

            In contrast, the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) take a more comprehensive approach through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR is the EU’s and EEA’s privacy legislation and applies to all controllers and processors, irrespective of their industry or sector. However, there are also some sector-specific laws in Europe, such as for the telecoms sector.

            While not an exhaustive list, several other countries across the globe–including Japan, Australia, China, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, India, South Africa, and more–operate their own privacy laws, or are working on drafting them. Even though each country may have their own law, most privacy laws across the globe are based on the same core principles.

                Fairness and Transparency
                Purpose Limitation
                Data Minimization
                Accuracy
                Data Deletion and Retention
                Security
                Accountability
                Individual Rights
                International Transfers
                Data Privacy Impact Assessments 

            We take a closer look at these principles in the next unit.
            Customer Contracts and Service Level Agreements

            In addition to complying with privacy laws, organizations include privacy commitments in customer contracts or service level agreements (SLAs). These commitments detail ways your organization can use personal data, including those required by applicable law.
            International Privacy Certifications and Standards

            In addition to privacy laws, your organization may also be required to comply with certain certifications and standards that impose comprehensive privacy requirements. These certifications and standards vary by industry, but may include:

                International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001/27018, which provide requirements for information security management systems and for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors
                Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, which help companies establish trust and confidence in their service delivery processes and controls
                TRUSTe certification, which enables organizations to demonstrate responsible practices consistent with standards for privacy accountability
                International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27701, which is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management. It provides guidelines for the processing of PII and helps organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their Privacy Information Management System (PIMS). 

            Privacy Policies

            Your organization should abide by the commitments made to customers when you collect personal data from individuals. Also, your organization should maintain a privacy statement on your public website that describes the types of data you collect from users of your websites, and how you use and share that data. The commitments you make in that privacy statement should be similar to the ones you make in the contracts you sign with your customers. The same is true for internal privacy policies and employee notices that detail how you collect, use, share, and process employee data.
            Sum It Up

            You now have a better understanding of privacy concepts, laws, and customer expectations. In the next unit, we cover privacy principles and how you can apply them to protect your organization.

                International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001/27018, which provide requirements for information security management systems and for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) in public clouds acting as PII processors
                Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, which help companies establish trust and confidence in their service delivery processes and controls
                TRUSTe certification, which enables organizations to demonstrate responsible practices consistent with standards for privacy accountability
                International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27701, which is an extension to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 for privacy information management. It provides guidelines for the processing of PII and helps organizations establish, implement, maintain, and continually improve their Privacy Information Management System (PIMS). 

            Privacy Policies

            Your organization should abide by the commitments made to customers when you collect personal data from individuals. Also, your organization should maintain a privacy statement on your public website that describes the types of data you collect from users of your websites, and how you use and share that data. The commitments you make in that privacy statement should be similar to the ones you make in the contracts you sign with your customers. The same is true for internal privacy policies and employee notices that detail how you collect, use, share, and process employee data.
            Sum It Up

            You now have a better understanding of privacy concepts, laws, and customer expectations. In the next unit, we cover privacy principles and how you can apply them to protect your organization.

            Apply Data Privacy Principles
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                List 10 key privacy principles.
                Explain how the principles can be implemented in your organization. 

            Privacy Principles

            Now that you have a good understanding of data privacy basics, let’s dive into some principles and how they apply to your organization. Although legal requirements vary globally, there are some common principles that provide the foundation for many privacy laws. Let’s delve into these principles which we introduced in the previous unit.

            Fairness and Transparency

            Organizations should process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent way.

            Your organization may implement this principle by processing personal data in accordance with applicable laws and the privacy commitments or service level agreements (SLAs) made to your customers and end users. As aforementioned, it’s also a good idea to publish a privacy statement on your website detailing what personal data is collected in your capacity as a data controller and why, including information collected through cookies and analytics. In your privacy statement, it’s important to indicate the information types that you will not collect. Ultimately, no matter how you receive privacy data, you should obtain consent before processing it. 

            Purpose Limitation

            Organizations should process personal data only for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes. 

            At your organization, this means that anytime you collect personal data, you clearly communicate and are specific about how the data will be used. In most cases, if you want to use the data for something other than what was communicated, you must present a valid legal reason and seek permission before processing it.

            Data Minimization

            Organizations should only collect the minimum amount of data necessary for the processing purpose in question. 

            Your organization shouldn’t collect personal data unless it’s necessary to perform your offered services. Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data shall be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed,” while the Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) calls this the “minimum necessary” rule.

            So, how does data minimization work? Let’s say you’re building an internal mobile app for your organization’s complimentary shuttle bus offered to employees. The data the app needs to collect and process includes employee personal data such as their home and office addresses, and other basic information (that is, name and phone number). However, the app doesn’t need an employee’s date of birth, ethnicity, or health or financial information. Since this additional information isn’t required, you shouldn’t collect it.

            Accuracy

            Personal data should be kept accurate and up to date.

            As a service provider to your customers, your organization needs to make sure your systems contain accurate records and reflect customer changes to data when they occur. Any data that’s considered inaccurate must have mechanisms to immediately erase or correct it.

            Data Deletion and Retention

            Organizations should only store personal data for as long as it’s required and for the originally intended purpose.

            Your organization shouldn’t keep data for an indefinite period even if it may be used in the future. Clear time frames should be established for when data is deleted with rationale for why the data is retained for that length of time. For example, you may need to retain security log files for certain periods of time to identify and track malicious adversary behaviors. However, the period still must remain finite, with supporting rationale. You should also be aware of data retention laws for specific types of data, such as legal documents, within the country where your organization provides that service.

            Security

            Organizations should use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect personal data against unauthorized processing, accidental disclosure, loss, destruction, and alteration. 

            Your organization needs to ensure that security systems adequately protect data. You can also help protect and secure the data you store through privacy enhancing techniques. Let’s discuss a few.

                Data segregation is the division of data into various data categories for the purposes of dividing or restricting access to different classes of data. Using this technique allows your organization to create separate access rules for datasets or different groups of users, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access.
                Encryption is a security method where information is scrambled into an unreadable format that can be accessed or decrypted only by a user with the correct key. Encryption protects the confidentiality of the data.
                Pseudonymization replaces the information that can identify a subject with pseudonyms or identifiers. It reduces the chance that personal data records and identifiers can identify an individual.
                Anonymization is the process of protecting private or sensitive information by erasing, obfuscating (masking), or encrypting it. It removes all identifiers associated with a person. 

            Other security measures may exist at your organization to support data protection. It’s recommended that all employees with access to computing systems receive privacy training regardless of position, and read and acknowledge employee acceptable use policies.

            Accountability

            Your organization should create policies and implement processes that demonstrate you’re in compliance with privacy laws, regulations, and principles for data privacy.

            You should take measures to advance privacy through design and privacy by default.

                Privacy by design: Privacy by design occurs when an organization begins planning for a new or improved process, or activity, or when developing a new product, service, or feature. 

            When your organization builds a new product, they should consider privacy policies and principles during the plan and design phase. It’s important to include all relevant stakeholders in this planning and design process, and legal teams, to make sure privacy is a priority and that your organization is abiding by the law.

                Privacy by default: Organizations should choose the most privacy-friendly default settings when collecting, processing, or storing personal data. For instance, if you were to sign up for an online social network account and plan to use one of its services, they may say they’re compliant with the privacy by default principle, requiring just your name and email address to function. However, if the social networking account immediately starts sharing your location or any other data outside of name and email address, they’re not adhering to the privacy by default principle. 

            Individual Rights

            Privacy laws also detail a data subject’s rights to their personal data. These rights include:

                Data subject access request: Data subjects have the right to access a copy of any personal data a controller holds about them and receive confirmation that a controller is processing their personal data. They’re also entitled to details about the purposes of the processing, the categories being processed, how long the data is stored, and with whom the personal data has been shared.
                Right to object: Data subjects can, in certain cases, object to how their personal data is used.
                Data correction: Data subjects can request that their personal data is corrected or completed if it’s inaccurate or incomplete.
                Restriction: Data subjects can request that a company stop processing their personal data in limited circumstances.
                Right to deletion: Also known as “the right to be forgotten,” or under GDPR, the right to erasure, this empowers data subjects to request that a controller delete their personal data under certain conditions. Because the US is sectoral-based regarding privacy, most US privacy laws don’t have this right. One exception is the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
                Data portability: Where applicable to the type of processing, data subjects have the right to ask a controller to provide their personal data in an exportable format so they can transmit their data to another controller. 

            Your organization’s obligation as a service provider is to assist your customers to manage these requests. As a controller, you’re responsible for complying with data subject requests, and the systems you use to manage personal data should accommodate such requests, including access, correction, deletion, and portability.

            International Transfers

            Certain countries and regions, such as the European Union (EU), restrict the transfer of personal data outside the country or region of origin unless the destination has implemented sufficient safeguards to guarantee the data is protected. If your organization operates internationally, you should implement measures that ensure you can legally transfer personal data across these boundaries.

            Data Protection Impact Assessment 

            When your organization collects, stores, or uses personal data, the individuals whose data you’re processing are exposed to risks. These risks range from theft with the intent to impersonate an individual, to accidental disclosure. Within GDPR, your organization is required to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA). According to the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL), a DPIA is designed to assess data likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of people, and to identify and minimize these risks as early as possible. Your organization may want to consider conducting a DPIA before launching data collection or processing activities that pose higher risks to data subjects.

            Get to Know Customer Data and Your Data Custodians
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Identify which information is considered customer data.
                Explain the difference between the two types of data custodians.
                Summarize what data custodians can and cannot do with data. 

            Customer Data

            The way we define customer data is that it’s the information submitted by or on behalf of a customer directly to one of your services. Customer data can take several forms and include the following.

                Personal data
                Contact information
                Account information
                Marketing data 

            Personal Data

            Personal data involves both personally identifiable information (PII) and non-PII. PII is any information used to recognize or link an individual to an identity. It includes items such as first or last name, physical address, protected health information (PHI), location, age, and more. Non-PII is anonymous information that can potentially identify more than one person (IP addresses, device identification, web cookies, and more).

            Contact Information

            Contact information provides the means to communicate with a person, such as a personal or business phone number or email address.

            Account Information

            Account information holds critical data about a customer’s user account, including name, order, billing, interaction, and credit information.

            Marketing Data

            Marketing data is any information that is of benefit to marketing teams, such as competitive intelligence, market research, commercial transactions, customer feedback, preferences and interests, and other metrics.

            You should define customer data in your service level agreements (SLAs) to stay in sync with your customers on what is considered customer data and what rules apply to it.
            What Is Not Customer Data

            Not all data your customers provide to you is considered customer data. For example, information your customers share with you via any means outside of your offered services is not customer data. This may include information your customer shares with you before they sign up for your services, or information you obtain from publicly available sources or third-party content providers. 
            Types of Data Custodians

            Now that you have a solid understanding of privacy laws, customer commitments, privacy principles, and what’s considered customer data, let’s introduce you to data custodians and discuss how they fit into the picture.

            There are likely two types of data custodians at your organization: personal and customer.

            Personal data custodians are those who access and handle personal data. Some examples of personal data custodians are:

                Salespeople who have access to customers’ and prospective customers’ personal data.
                Marketing personnel who manage email and digital marketing to individuals.
                Human resources, IT, payroll, security, managers, and other personnel who have access to employee data. 

            Customer data custodians access and handle customer data (which can include personal data). These custodians are generally a selected group of employees within your organization who have access to customer data. Typically, customer data custodians fall under technical support operations or customer support.

            While there are some requirements that apply to both personal data custodians and customer data custodians, there are typically additional requirements that apply only to customer data custodians. That’s because customer data is subject to your customer contracts and SLAs, which may go beyond what privacy laws require. Let’s look at some baseline requirements for data custodians.

            Data Custodian Responsibilities

                Implement technical controls for safeguarding data confidentiality.
                Limit, authorize, and control access to personal and customer data.
                Maintain technical processes to sustain data integrity.
                Validate that data added to datasets are consistent with a common data model.
                Process, access, handle, or view personal or customer data as necessary to perform their duties.
                Adhere to policies on internal and external data sharing. 

            If you’re unsure about sharing personal data outside of your organization, contact your legal department for assistance.

            Report Data Privacy Security Incidents
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain what constitutes a data privacy security incident.
                Identify potential data privacy security incidents.
                Know what to do when you suspect or know a data privacy security incident has happened. 

            What Is a Security Incident?

            Many authorities around the world have adopted security incident notification laws, from the European Union (EU) to countries in Latin America (LATAM) to Japan and Asia-Pacific (JAPAC) regions to every United States (US) state and territory. Recently in the US, the president signed into law the Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act of 2022, which requires critical infrastructure companies to report significant cybersecurity incidents and all ransom payments to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

            Depending on the country your organization operates out of, there are numerous incident reporting laws and regulations for specific industries such as government, healthcare, energy, telecoms, and financial services providers, with each adopting their own definition of what constitutes a security incident (or data breach). Depending on the security incident notification laws that impact your organization, your customer service level agreements (SLAs) or contracts should contain security incident notification requirements that apply to customer data.

            A data privacy security incident is any unauthorized use of personal data or customer data, whether accidental or intended. Consider these examples of common security incidents.

                A sales representative sends an email with customer data to the wrong customer.
                A manager prints a resume of a candidate, but on his way home, he leaves the document on the train.
                A former employee who has left the company still has access to your organization’s systems and accesses customer records.
                An intern opens an email attachment containing malware, which results in deleted or encrypted customer contact information.
                A shared drive is overly permissioned, granting too many people access to personal data.
                A customer’s credentials or secret keys are exposed on a public GitHub repository.
                An employee’s work device (for example, a laptop or smartphone) is lost or stolen.
                An employee accidentally discloses personal data in a response to an email that turns out to be part of a phishing attack. 

            All these incidents qualify as potential security incidents and should be reported to your organization’s security team.
            Reporting a Security Incident

            If you suspect a potential data privacy incident, report it immediately, even if you’re not 100% sure the incident qualifies as a data breach or security incident. If your organization has an annual security awareness training program in place, make sure to review it for up-to-date information regarding how to report suspicious activity or suspected security incidents at your organization.

            When reporting an incident, you should provide as much information as possible, including:

                What happened
                Who the individuals or groups involved were
                The time, date, and time zone of when the incident occurred
                Which services were involved or potentially impacted
                Point of contact for follow-up questions 

            Security Incident Reporting Timelines

            Your organization may have a legal obligation to report data privacy incidents within a short time frame to regulators, customers, and affected individuals. You have an obligation to report security incidents immediately to your internal security team, to allow them time to investigate the incident and meet external reporting requirements. In some cases, failure to notify applicable parties of a data privacy incident within the required time frames can lead to substantial fines, a potential breach of your contractual obligations, damage to customer trust, and tarnishing of your organization’s reputation.

            As you can see, it’s critical to report all potential security incidents right away, even if you made the mistake that led to the exposure of personal or customer data.

            Get to Know the Public Sector
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Define the public sector.
                Describe the types of work performed in the public sector.

            Before You Start

            If you completed the Get Started with Cloud Security Engineering trail then you already know about cloud computing and how to design secure cloud solutions. Now, let’s talk about how to improve the security of public sector data in the cloud.
            Overview of the Public Sector

            The public sector consists of national, state, and local governments. These entities provide critical infrastructure like roads, bridges, and water. They operate public transportation. They administer elections. They even strengthen national defense and secure national security systems. In recent years, many public sector organizations have adopted digital technology to provide better service and more transparency for their citizens. However, this broad array of service offerings makes these public sector entities attractive to a variety of cybersecurity threat actors.

            To improve speed, scale, and cost of these digital technologies, many public sector organizations are migrating and modernizing some or all public services using cloud-based offerings. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources—for example, networks, servers, storage, applications (apps), and services—that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. 

            Cloud computing provides public sector organizations the flexibility and scalability to meet modern technology demands. These organizations may use their own cloud for internal resources. Or they can use the secure cloud services of a private company—also known as a cloud service provider (CSP)—approved specifically for public sector organizations. They can even use a distributed hybrid deployment model that employs a mix of public sector infrastructure and private cloud services. 

            The shift to cloud computing has helped improve cybersecurity by taking advantage of the security expertise offered by CSPs. But it isn't without risk. Mapping out those risks and their impacts is critical to assuring the cloud and the data residing in it remains secure.

            Cloud Security

            Cloud security consists of a set of policies, controls, procedures, and technologies that work together to protect cloud-based systems, data, and infrastructure. These security measures are configured to protect cloud data, support regulatory compliance, and safeguard customers’ privacy.

            Cloud security responsibilities are shared between public sector organizations and CSPs in contrast to a public sector-owned and managed data center. Depending on the cloud configuration and licensing agreement, public sector users may have more or less control over how shared resources and data are accessed. It’s important to note that moving to the cloud does not transfer security responsibility to the CSP. While the CSP may operate certain security controls on the public sector organizaton’s behalf, the public sector customer is ultimately responsible for validating that they do so effectively.

            Cloud Service Models

            NIST defines the following cloud service models in order of level of management provided by CSP vendors.

                Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Vendors provide the basic infrastructure and hardware.
                Platform as a Service (PaaS): Vendors provide a managed environment for a customer’s app.
                Software as a Service (SaaS): Vendors provide a fully managed app, and customers need only supply their data.

            When customer data is processed, stored, or transmitted off-premise and under the control of a third party, such as a CSP, the ability of the data owner to implement security controls is often limited. In cloud computing environments, the implementation of controls is largely dependent upon the type of service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), the type of cloud deployment model (private, public, hybrid, multi-cloud), the type of controls (physical versus logical), and the specifications of responsibility delineated in the contract between the public sector organization and the CSP.

            It’s critical that public sector customers choose services accordingly and understand the risks and limitations of third-party control. Public sector organizations can outsource the functionality of a role, such as storage management, but must still verify security requirements like encryption are implemented. Whether you’re a private CSP employee or a public sector employee, if you have access to public sector cloud services, you have privileged access to critical infrastructure, networks, and data. Let’s dig a bit deeper into what makes public sector cloud security concerns unique. 
            Public Sector Data Security Requirements

            Public sector cloud services have unique security compliance requirements. Data stored in a public sector cloud platform must be adequately maintained and secured to meet these special compliance requirements. As more organizations adopt the cloud, public sector organizations have created a number of security aids, standards, and regulations to safeguard those transitions. The table lists some regulations and standards that outline public sector data security requirements in the US.  

            Regulation/Standard
            	

            Description

            Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002 and Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014
            	

            Strengthens information security within US federal agencies by requiring them to implement information security programs to ensure their systems’ confidentiality, integrity, and availability

            NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
            	

            Provides a framework for federal agencies, contractors, and other sources that use or operate a federal information system to develop and implement a risk-based approach to manage information security risk

            Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS PUB 199)
            	

            Outlines impact levels of data, which are are a way of categorizing the sensitivity of data and what controls are necessary to secure data of varying sensitivity levels

            NIST 800-53
            	

            Defines security controls for information systems (including cloud systems) containing public sector data, including access control, media protection, and physical and environmental protections

            Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
            	

            Defines security baselines for cloud services based upon the NIST 800-53 controls

            Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide
            	

            Builds upon FedRAMP to tailor control baselines for DoD mission owners by providing a knowledge base for cloud computing security authorization processes and security requirements 

            Here are some examples of security compliance requirements for public sector cloud services in other countries.

                India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) provides requirements and guidelines for CSPs to register their services with the Indian government to be considered eligible to work with public sector entities in India.
                The Japanese government has a system called the Information System Security Management and Assessment Program (ISMAP) for assessing the security of CSPs to participate in public sector projects.
                The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) has an Information Security Registered Assessor’s Program (IRAP) framework, which assesses the implementation and effectiveness of an organization’s security controls against the Australian government’s security requirements.

            Discover more comprehensive compliance certifications and attestations. No matter the country, cloud security compliance requirements put in place data location constraints, requirements for identity management, privacy, confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), and more. 
            Threat Actor Targets and Meeting Compliance Standards

            Whether you’re a private CSP employee or a public sector employee with access to critical security systems, infrastructure, networks, and accounts, you’re a primary target for cybercriminals and foreign intelligence organizations. Combating all such threats is critical to national security and a well-functioning civil society. As a critical part of an organization’s defenses, you play an important role in protecting privacy and security.

            As someone with access to public sector data, you need to be aware of, understand, and follow the increased security, privacy, and compliance measures that platforms containing this data require, and what threats to public sector cloud services may look like. This requires validating on an ongoing basis that the security controls you’ve selected are actually implemented and functioning properly. Luckily, CSPs provide a range of features and services that public sector customers can use to build cloud solutions to meet their security needs.

            Risks of Misuse of Public Sector Data

            There are varying levels of risk to public sector data if the CIA of the data is compromised. Depending on the type of information breached, a victim can suffer social, economic, or physical harm. If an identity thief gets hold of the compromised information, the victim may face financial loss, damaged credit, compromised medical records, threats, or harassment.

            If public sector data is misused, your organization can also suffer financially. If the root cause of data loss is due to your organization not adhering to laws and regulations, your organization or its staff can be subject to criminal or civil penalties, or incur additional costs associated with responding and recovering from the incident, including having to fund credit monitoring for your customers.

            Your organization can also be required to receive close scrutiny from regulators. In the end, organizations can put their public reputation at risk and shatter public confidence if they don’t protect public sector data. As someone with access to public sector data, it’s your responsibility to review and assess the risks associated with misuse of public sector data, and do your part to minimize them.
            Sum It Up

            Now that you understand more about the public sector and why users dealing with public sector data are potential cybersecurity targets, let’s take a look at one specific type of threat to public sector data security: insider threat.

            Identify Insider Threats to Public Sector Data
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain the concept of insider threat.
                Define insiders and insider threat categories.
                Identify ways insider threats can happen at your organization.
                Explain ways you can defend yourself from insider threat.
                Identify insider threat and security reporting recommendations.

            What Is Insider Threat?

            An insider is any individual who has access to your organization’s facilities, systems, technology, customer data, or staff. Insiders can include public sector employees, former employees, contractors, subcontractors, and even customers. As more information is stored in the cloud, staff with access to these systems could potentially threaten your organization.

            Cybersecurity measures are frequently focused on threats from outside an organization rather than from individuals inside an organization. However, insider threats are the source of many security incidents across industries. They can potentially steal sensitive data, perform malicious attacks on your networks, and damage or destroy systems and services. 

            There are generally two categories of insider threat: accidental and intentional. Some behaviors that lead to unintentional threats include:

                Using unauthorized removable media
                Using personal email for work activities
                Falling for phishing emails
                Using unauthorized applications (apps) and software
                Failing to fully test changes to systems before pushing them to widespread use

            On the flip side, intentional insiders use their access deliberately to cause malicious harm. For example, they may steal confidential information about public sector services for personal or financial gain, or damage systems or destroy data in retribution for a missed promotion, involuntary termination, or other grievance. 
            Challenges to Detecting Insider Threats

            Malicious acts by insiders are seldom impulsive. Usually, stressful events happen over time that result in the transition of a trusted insider to a malicious one. If not identified and resolved in a healthy manner, these stressors could contribute to an individual’s intent to cause harm to your organization and its staff. That’s why it’s important to identify and resolve potential stressors early on. Additionally, external factors can be at play. An insider could be targeted by an external organization and bribed, or could be extorted.

            Insider threat actors can be difficult to detect and often go unnoticed. As someone who deals with public sector data in the cloud, you serve as the eyes and ears of the organization, and need to pay attention to indicators of insider risk.
            What Are Risk Indicators?

            There are two types of risk indicators: direct and indirect. Direct risk indicators include the following types of behavior.

                Occasional display of suspicious or disruptive behavior
                Attempts to gain access to information or data that’s outside the scope of an employee’s job responsibilities, including attempts to recruit or coerce others into giving information or doing something suspicious
                Bullying or sexual harassment of fellow employees
                Workplace violence incidents
                Serious violations of organization cloud policies
                Disregard of security procedures and protocols
                Financial changes including unexplained affluence or excessive debt
                Working or show up for work under the influence
                Physical and logical access to facilities or proprietary information outside of normal work hours

            Indirect risk indicators are behaviors that require additional analysis to reveal suspicious motives. They can include the following.

                Visible animosity toward a coworker
                Sudden decline in work performance
                Irresponsible use of social media

            Defend Against Insider Threats

            Measures to defend against insider threats include documenting expectations in security agreements, monitoring, cooperating with Human Resources (HR), implementing data protections, and reporting in a timely manner. Let’s take a closer look.

            Security Agreements

            To help protect against insider threats, public sector employees should define explicit security agreements for any cloud services, especially regarding access restrictions and monitoring capabilities. Public sector data hosted in a private sector cloud service provider (CSP) is under the care of a third party. Malicious insiders who work for the CSP might be able to access the data stored in the cloud for multiple public sector organizations.

            One tool to consider in strengthening the security of cloud systems containing public sector data is to put in place terms and conditions to document trust relationships between organizations owning, operating, or maintaining the information systems. For example, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) moderate baseline recommends this control. These agreements can help document expectations around access to the information system, and how information is processed, stored, or transmitted. Whether this step is necessary depends on the compliance regimes applicable to the organization, and what existing sharing and trust agreements exist between the organizations.

            Security Assessments

            Another tool for defending against insider threat and bolstering the security of cloud systems containing public sector data is to develop a security assessment plan. For example, the FedRAMP moderate baseline recommends agencies to assess security controls on both an initial and ongoing basis, continuously monitor their IT systems, and ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures, among other security practices.

            Monitoring

            Whether you work at a public sector organization, a CSP, or a third-party vendor, if you process and store public sector data in the cloud, you have a responsibility to monitor that data. Security monitoring in the cloud includes capturing, reviewing, and correlating audit log data. Also consider logging and reviewing all activities performed by users within cloud environments. Check for events such as abnormal login times or attempts to access unauthorized resources.

            Organizations dealing with public sector data can consider using user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) solutions that use algorithms and machine learning to detect anomalies in the behavior of not only the users in a corporate network but also the routers, servers, and endpoints in that network. UEBA can help you to recognize any peculiar or suspicious behavior, such as instances where there are irregularities from normal everyday patterns or usage. For example, if a network user regularly downloads files of 20 megabytes every day but starts downloading 40 gigabytes of files, the UEBA system considers this an anomaly and alerts an information technology (IT) admin. Or if automations are in place, it automatically disconnects that user from the network.

            Integrate with Human Resources

            Another important measure is integrating insider threat defenses with Human Resources (HR). HR professionals are more likely to identify patterns, behavior, and trends that help mitigate potential harm to an organization and its employees. For example, HR can identify red flags during the interview process, creating mechanisms for employees and managers to provide two-way feedback and share concerns. HR can also provide suggestions for delivering notifications of termination respectfully and in a way that minimizes intrusiveness and embarrassment. Depending upon an employee’s role, there may also be separation agreements that are required to continue confidentiality post-employment.

            HR also has insights to employee performance records and potential disciplinary actions for correlating events back to certain behaviors. It’s critical that HR perform pre-hire background checks that are regularly updated after hire, obtain employee acknowledgement of policies and practices, and provide training on insider threats.

            Data Protections

            Additionally, it’s important that public sector organizations ensure that their data protection and monitoring requirements for CSPs are commensurate with the organization’s own requirements. It’s vital that protections include physical and technological requirements, and HR requirements for CSP employees.

            Timely Reporting

            As someone who works with public sector data, you can serve as the first line of defense for insider threats by reporting unusual activity to your organization’s security team. Your organization’s incident response team can investigate unauthorized access to data or attempts to circumvent security configurations by keeping an eye on suspicious activities or threat indicators. Depending on your organization’s requirements, you may also need to report unusual activity to your human resources team, or outside groups such as law enforcement.

             

            If something at work doesn’t feel right—an unusual access request or information request, for example—don’t hesitate to contact your organization’s incident response or security team right away. Keep in mind that the longer an attacker is on your network, the deeper they can go, the more backdoors they can open, and the more data they may be able to extract. Any public sector data displayed outside the cloud’s authorized boundaries constitutes a security incident and should be reported immediately. This applies not only to customer data but also to any information that can impact the CIA of the cloud environment.

            Acting fast when you spot a potential security incident is critical, because it helps your incident response team track down the source and thwart any potential damage. What’s more, if your organization has a security incident involving public sector data, you may be subject to external reporting requirements. For example, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), organizations have just 72 hours to gather all related information and report data breaches to the relevant regulator.

            By reporting suspected incidents to your organization’s incident response team immediately, your organization is better able to meet its external reporting requirements. If your organization fails to meet these requirements, you can incur fines, damage customer and investor trust, and continue to repeat past mistakes.
            Sum It Up

            In this unit, you learned about insider threats and the concern they pose for protecting public sector data in the cloud. Now, let’s turn our attention to an important security control to consider when managing and protecting public sector data in the cloud: access control.

            Secure Public Sector Data
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe how to safeguard high value assets in the cloud.
                Explain how to securely handle public sector data in the cloud.
                Identify media protections for public sector data in the cloud.
                List best practices for data backup and storage in the cloud.

            Now that we’ve talked about access control and encryption, let’s continue by discussing data handling controls for protecting public sector data in the cloud.
            High-Value Assets

            High-value assets (HVAs)—that sounds important, doesn’t it? That’s because it is! An HVA is information or an information system that is so critical to an organization that the loss or corruption of this information or loss of access to the system results in a serious impact on the organization’s ability to perform its mission or conduct business. It’s no surprise then that it’s essential to have special controls in place to protect these types of assets, especially when hosted in the cloud. These controls should be outlined in your organization’s data classification standard. The last thing you want is for a cybercriminal to gain unauthorized access to high value asset data, including public sector information!

            To identify and protect high-value assets, start with a business impact analysis (BIA), which predicts the consequences of disruption of a business function and gathers information needed to develop recovery strategies. During the BIA, identify potential loss scenarios and associated costs from a compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of mission critical data. Also identify recommendations for recovery. Depending upon the data contained in the HVA, it may be necessary to conduct other reviews, such as a Privacy Impact Assessment.

            Because of the importance of safeguarding HVAs, only allow as small as necessary a subset of your organization’s employees access to them. Have policies and procedures in place for managing HVAs, and cover protections while the data is stored in your systems and when it’s shared externally.
            Secure Data Handling

            To make sure you handle public sector data in a way that complies with your organization’s requirements, always keep sensitive data in controlled, approved, and secure cloud environments with backup capabilities. Production servers provide greater security than your laptop, for example. Here are some additional steps you can take to keep public sector data secure.

                Avoid accessing public sector data unless it’s required for your job.
                Only access the data from an authorized or approved device issued by your organization.
                Avoid downloading data to your computer, unless required for your job.
                Do not export any information from a cloud environment whose disclosure can impact the CIA of the environment.
                Do not use an external email account to send information.
                Use only approved third-party storage sites.
                Limit printing of data to only what’s necessary for your job, and keep your desk clean of sensitive data when stepping away or leaving for the day.
                Encrypt and back up data to mitigate risk if data is lost or stolen.
                Do not store information on Universal Serial Buses (USBs) or external hard drives.

            You may be wondering what type of information disclosure can impact the CIA of your environment. This can include, for example, if a medical provider at the Department of Veterans Affairs exports patient data from the cloud system hosting that data, and emails it to the wrong patient. In determining potential impact, it’s key you consider the quantity of sensitive data. For example, breaches of 25 records of personally identifiable information (PII) and 25 million records may have different impacts. 

            Also evaluate the sensitivity of the data fields when combined. Aggregating different data sets can increase the potential impact to the information if disclosed improperly. For this reason, it’s best to de-identify information where possible by removing account numbers, names, and other identifiable information when aggregating information.

            Media Protection

            Whether at a cloud service provider (CSP) or a public sector organization, a limited number of employees need access to media that contains public sector data. It’s imperative that your organization maintains a media protection policy that describes how to properly handle backup tapes and other digital media like portable hard drives and USBs. In the policy, address media marking, storage, transport, sanitization, disposal, and use. If you’re in a position with access to media containing public sector data, it’s critical to review your organization’s policies and familiarize yourself with these processes.

            Data Backup and Storage

            In addition to identifying your mission critical data, it’s crucial that your organization backs up this data to maintain accessibility to pertinent information. Per your organization’s information security standards, back up public sector data in the cloud at a frequency consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives. Define these objectives in your BIA. Define specific guidelines pertaining to these objectives by the regulations and standards applicable to your organization’s jurisdiction.

                The recovery time objective (RTO) documents the amount of time an organization has to restore its processes to an acceptable service level after a disruption to avoid intolerable consequences associated with the disruption.
                The recovery point objective (RPO) documents how fresh the recovered data must be.

            Protect backup information and media at all storage locations, whether in the cloud or at an off-site storage facility. Sanitize, destroy, or both, data that’s no longer required in line with your organization’s data retention policy or standard. Define specific guidelines pertaining to data sanitization by the regulations and standards applicable to your organization's jurisdiction. Consider using a combination of online and offline backups for further recovery options.
            The Bottom Line

            You are the strongest link in your organization’s security efforts. You now have the knowledge to protect and safeguard your organization and customers. As someone who deals with public sector data in the cloud, you’re entrusted with very sensitive data. It’s up to you to be compliant and vigilant in your efforts to stay secure. Don’t forget, if you see something, say something by contacting your organization’s security team. Interested in learning more about cybersecurity careers and technologies?

            Identify Secrets
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Identify three types of secrets at your organization.
                Define authentication, authorization, and encryption.
                Explain strong key management principles. 

            What Is a Secret?

            Customer trust issues can derail even the best-laid cybersecurity plans. Your customers rely on you to safeguard their data, and to keep that data safe from anyone who does not have a business need to access it, even someone inside your organization’s network. While protections like network segmentation protect data, code, and applications from external and internal threats, it’s still up to you to manage secret information carefully. 

            So, just what is a secret? You can define secrets in three main ways. 

                Credentials that authenticate individual identities for systems and services
                Private keys used to sign certificates that authorize services to other services
                Keys used to encrypt other secret information like customer data 

            If you start with these definitions, you can sort your secrets into categories. The first category is passwords, or other credentials that you use to protect your laptop, phone, and organizational access. The second category is the private keys that services use to provide access to sensitive systems, services, and information. And the third category is the keys used to encrypt content like customer and organizational data, so that even if it is accessed, it is kept secret. 

            Password Versus Key

            For most computer security purposes and for most users, a key is not the same thing as a password, although a password can be used as a key. The primary difference between keys and passwords is that passwords are intended to be generated, read, remembered, and reproduced by a human user. 

            A key, by contrast, is intended for use by the software that is implementing the cryptographic algorithm, so human readability is not required. In fact, most users are, in most cases, unaware of the existence of the keys being used on their behalf by the security components of their everyday software applications.

            Secrets are never as simple as they seem, and handling secrets well involves several tricky factors. When managing secrets, here are some good questions to ask.

            How secret is this secret? How many humans know it? How many places is it stored? How hard would it be for an attacker to learn or guess it? Good secrets should be very hard to guess and obtain if you’re not supposed to have them.

            Will this secret always be available when needed? Let’s say your service needs a secret to do its job. If the service storing that secret goes down, your customers are going to have a rough day without access to the system they need. The availability of secrets depends on the availability of your service overall.

            As your organization continues to innovate with new technologies, effective secret management becomes even more important.
            Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption

            There are three main ways to protect secrets: authentication, authorization, and encryption. They are all related, and they often overlap with one another. Sometimes they are used in combination, such as when a system authenticates your identity and then checks whether you’re authorized to access that system. At other times, systems encrypt secrets so that they cannot be understood without being decrypted.  

            Authentication

            Authentication is the process of proving your identity. Let’s say you are trying to log in to your company’s website as yourself. The website asks you to enter your password so it knows it’s you. Authentication assures you that a call is actually coming from a service you trust and not from an attacker. 

            Authentication can be single-factor or multi-factor (MFA). A factor is what you use to authenticate, and it falls into one of three categories.

                Something you have: Examples include a proximity key like a wireless key fob, or a magnetic strip card like your personal debit card
                Something you are: Examples include a fingerprint or facial identification
                Something you know: Examples include a password, passphrase, or personal identification number (PIN) 

            Single-factor authentication is when you use just one of these factors to authenticate, such as when you type in your username and password (something you know) to log in to your email. MFA requires two or more of these items, like when you use your credit card (something you have) and enter your PIN (something you know) to complete a transaction. 

            Authorization 

            Authorization is the next step after authentication. Now that you have verified your identity, what are you allowed to do? One user shouldn’t be authorized to change another user’s password, for example.

            Another example of authorization, are the resources you have access to for your job. If you work on the Finance team, you shouldn’t be able to access a Human Resources database, and vice versa. You only see the resources that you are authorized to use. 

            For high-security processes, you may need to demonstrate that you’re authorized by more than one group in order to gain access. This is known as quorum authorization. For example, if you’re an auditor and need temporary access to a secure financial system, you may require approval from both the business owner of the system and a senior administrator. This method prevents any one group from providing access to secure systems without sufficient authorization.

            Encryption 

            Encryption uses mathematical equations to scramble data so that they appear to be random. Only parties with the right secret key can decrypt the contents. Even if attackers can intercept the data your service sends or stores, encryption prevents them from understanding the true contents of the data without the secret key.

            All of these techniques require secrets, and they require those secrets to be stored securely. If an attacker knows the password or the decryption key, it doesn’t matter how sophisticated your authentication or encryption schemes are. 

            Let’s take a look at some best practices for managing these keys. 
            Manage Your Encryption Keys

            Just as there are questions you should ask yourself about secrets management, there are also factors to consider when you manage keys. 

            Make It Durable

            If you permanently lose a key used to encrypt data, you’ve effectively lost the data no matter how many backups you have of the encrypted bits. This situation can be especially challenging with secrets, because the usual response (make lots of backup copies!) conflicts with the first principle of secrets management, which is to keep the secret secret. You can make your keys more durable by backing them up and storing them in an additional secure location to ensure that you still have access to the keys in case one location is destroyed in a disaster. This can be performed by using the native backup options provided by your application or by using a dedicated encryption key backup system.

            Change It

            It’s best to use an automated process to change keys regularly. Doing so allows you to test your key management process of changing secrets to prevent unauthorized access. It also allows you to take action if an attacker is able to steal a secret. By changing the key, the attacker might have the data, but they would be unable to unlock it, rendering it useless. 

            Declare Cryptoperiods

            A cryptoperiod is the lifetime of a key. When you generate a key, you should declare a cryptoperiod. It’s then tracked throughout the usage of the key. For some scenarios, like transport layer security (TLS) certificates used for secure web communication, the protocol directly supports this concept, and using it as designed automatically sets a cryptoperiod expiration limit. The cryptoperiod for TLS is designated by the notBefore and notAfter fields specifying the validity period.

            When a cryptoperiod expires, copies of the key material are destroyed or rendered useless, and this process is logged. In the case of data encrypted at rest, take care to ensure the data is reencrypted with an active key or keys prior to discarding the key material. Also, once key material has reached the end of its lifetime, do not reuse it for other purposes. Be sure to generate new keys for any needs beyond the expiration date.

            After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

                Explain the consumer’s expectations of service.
                Describe how emerging technologies can impact your contact center design.
                Describe the Salesforce Service Cloud Advantage.

            Welcome to the Age of the Customer

            Customer service has evolved, and it has shattered the idea of call center business as usual.

            Today’s customers are digital and on the move. They connect to each other instantly through multiple channels, and they expect the same from the companies they deal with. Let’s look at how Service Cloud can help your call center team exceed your customers’ ever-demanding expectations.

            According to top researcher Forrester, “The ability to align products, operations, and business models to what we call a ‘customer-obsessed operating model’ will determine a company's ultimate success.” In other words, for businesses to keep customers happy and to stay competitive, you must invest in sophisticated technology that lets your contact center deliver top-notch service on every channel.
            Change Channels—and Customer Interactions

            The way in which customers contact you is always shifting: calling, emailing, texting, and so on. The shift will continue as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more commonplace. Brace yourself for AI to disrupt customer support jobs, as nonhuman interactions are on the rise. For example, with the Internet of Things (IOT), a washing machine can predict the need to purchase more detergent and instantly connect with a retailer’s app (such as Amazon Alexa) to place and confirm the order. This is not to say we don’t need service agents, but the way they interact with customers is changing fast. Human interaction will still be required on many of the customer service cases coming through your organization. But as new technology makes contacting service easier, more accessible, and instant, the overall volume of customer service interactions through multiple channels will continue to climb.
            So What’s Next?

            Agents must become experts in all customer engagement channels to make their customer interactions more personalized and, well, human. But what happens if your agents don’t have the right tools to meet the shifting demands of customers? Customer frustration can increase as brand loyalty decreases, ultimately leading to lower CSAT and NPS scores...and greater attrition.

            That’s why leading organizations understand the need for an intelligent, flexible customer service platform that can give their agents the tools to make their jobs easier, and meet the higher demands of today’s customers. And it’s why organizations are digitally transforming their customer contact centers with the Service Cloud platform.
            The Service Cloud Advantage: Connect with Connected Customers

            It’s not necessary to make things overcomplicated to offer an omnichannel experience. You can make it happen in a single platform.

            Here’s how: Service Cloud gives your agents the power to deliver service that bridges the gap from a transaction to an interaction. It’s as instant and easy as a conversation, on whatever channel your customers are using—from a single platform. Now your agents can respond in real-time to any customer, anywhere.

                Phone
                Text/SMS
                Email
                Websites

                Self-service site
                Two-way video chat

            Give Agents a Single, 360-Degree Customer View

             

            Imagine this: Every single service agent can turn to their desktop and have a real-time view of a customer's entire journey with your company. And they can then use that information to offer personalized service—fast.

            The  Lightning Service Console is designed with agents in mind. And since the console is built on the Salesforce platform, your agents can access information from different systems across the company. This enables agents to access everything they need to provide quality customer service from one screen.
            Boost Agent Productivity—and Customer Happiness

             

            It’s not unusual for companies to have 10 or 20 systems that agents use to find all a customer’s information. If agents have all of that information on one screen, they can solve customers’ issues much faster, and work more efficiently. And you can boost customer satisfaction and your ROI. With the Lightning Service Console, everything an agent needs is right at their fingertips so that they can deliver:

                Faster service: Rapidly work through any backlog of cases with tools that eliminate clicks and let agents take care of customers quickly, increase customer satisfaction levels, and stay motivated by feeling agile and productive.
                Smarter service : Agents can be proactive service gurus, address inefficiencies before they happen, and feel empowered with the right information to make more informed decisions that help build lasting customer relationships.
                Personalized service : “ 68% of consumers say it’s very important for service agents to know their full history.” Regardless of channel, your agents can always know everything about your customer. Whether it’s past issues, purchase history, or data from a backend system, everything’s all in one place.

            So get ready to leapfrog the competition as you deliver on the personalized experiences your customer cares about most.
            Help Customers Help Themselves with Self-Service Sites

            Did you know that most customers prefer not to talk to a live agent? In fact, “81% of them try self-service first.” So how can you offer personalized self-service on any channel a customer chooses?

            With Service Cloud, you can create a single, branded Experience Cloud site that your customers can access to find what they need, on any device, anywhere they go. This frees agents to spend more time working on the toughest cases.

            So what about those questions going unanswered in self-service sites?

            Salesforce Experience Cloud sites integrate with Service Cloud. Customers can create cases manually, agents can escalate customer questions to cases, and managers can set workflows to escalate cases if a question hasn't been answered
            Meet Rising Customer Expectations on Every Channel

            Everyone appreciates a genuine conversation. That goes for customers, too. It’s time for service agents to ditch the call script and engage with customers with more personalized conversations.

            Research shows that the “service customers experience from your center influences the level of service they expect to experience in their next contact.” It’s important to understand what customers expect from your organization, so you can reposition the contact center to meet shifting expectations quickly and efficiently. Let’s look at how to do that.

            Best Practices for Omnichannel Call Center Success

            1. Customer service is a team sport:

                Ensure that everyone in your service organization, from agents to your management team, thoroughly understands your top 10 basic customer expectations.
                Be sure to post them prominently.

            Happy agent with headsetService Team Tip

            Have your service center management memorize the list of top 10

            customer expectations, and make a habit of considering them when

            making decisions.

            2. Don’t guess what customers want. Go straight to the source: the customer.

                Create services based on what customers really expect.
                Then listen to customer interactions with agents and social channels. Take frequent and detailed surveys to get insight on how you’re meeting the team’s 10 expectations.

            Consider posting a scorecard based on customer feedback to keep

            managers and agents up to date on changing customer expectations.

            3. Exceed expectations.

                Steve Jobs said, “Customers don’t usually know what they want until you show it to them.” Go beyond the status quo and give customers more than what they ask for, and differentiate your brand through service.
                Transform your call center now to get a jump-start on the future.

            to learn how Salesforce can help predict what a customer needs before
            they ask for it.

            4. Build cross-functional teams.

                Make customer service a team sport by serving customers across your organization.
                Use your company’s combined information, support, processes, products, and services to meet and exceed customer expectations.

            Happy agent with headsetManagement Tip
            Use Salesforce Experience Cloud sites within your own organization to keep
            everyone connected and engaged across divisions. This better supports
            your service organization.

            5. Let your customers guide your strategy.

                Ensure that the evolving customer expectations are central to how you approach your customer relationships.
                Enable your customers to drive everything, including segmentation, the channels you make available, service-level objectives, your hours of operation, and more.

            Management Tip
            Consider adding customer surveys that include capturing their operational
            preferences alongside service-level expectations.


            Now you have a few new service strategies to give your customers simplified, fast, convenient, and consistent services, that can build loyalty and turn them into your brand ambassador.

            Turn Customer Service Agents into Agents of Change

            Turnover statistics at most call centers reveal a truly scary picture, with plenty of effort and training dollars wasted, as experienced agents jump ship for better opportunities. Want to figure out how to stop wasting time and money? Here’s a step-by-step guide to implement a strong digital contact center hiring and onboarding program.
            Step One: Hire the Right Agents

            Service agent talks to customer on the phone

            If you want to offer exceptional customer service, start by transforming your hiring process. Improving the hiring process boosts the overall performance of your operation and customer service, while cutting the cost of providing that service. So now you’re ready to hire stellar agents. Let’s examine the most important qualities to look for in every new hire, as outlined by  Kevin Hegebarth, an expert in customer service and hiring excellent candidates.

                Technical knowledge: They have a solid understanding for the industry and basic resolution skills.
                Ability to multitask: They must thrive in a hectic environment and be able to jump from one issue to another quickly.
                Pleasant phone etiquette: Candidates must have the ability to engage with customers in a pleasant manner and be able to hold a fluid conversation.
                Ability to stay calm, cool, and collected: They’re able to remain calm and resourceful in any situation, regardless of the circumstances.
                Ability to focus: They have the ability to stay present and focused on delivering the best possible service to each and every customer.
                Solution-oriented thinkers: They display a high level of confidence and a propensity to search for a resolution themselves or direct their customers to the appropriate personnel who can provide an answer.
                Ability to listen and put the customer first: They can use empathy and patience to ensure customers feel catered to and confident that the support representative is hearing their issue and is knowledgeable in the subject matter.

            Step Two: Build a Winning Agent Team

            As more people are doing business online, your customer service team is increasingly becoming the center of business growth. Kevin Hegebarth suggests four strategies you can use to build your winning agent workforce.

            Four Key Strategies for Hiring Success 


            Decorative image of a birdThe Early Bird Gets the Worm

            The competition for qualified agent labor is fierce. Make a decision quickly for the best chance to snag the best talent in your market. Applicants are more likely to accept job offers that are made quickly. And that timely hiring decision tends to have a positive effect on the prospective employee’s performance once on the job.

            Decorative image of a notification bell icon Let Candidates Know

            According to a 2013 national survey by CareerBuilder, over 75% of applicants never hear anything from a hiring company. Zero. Zilch. Nothing. Yet, 82% of them expect some kind of response, even a simple “thanks, but no thanks.” Don’t let your hiring process become a black hole. Responding to each application helps bolster your brand perception on company review sites and leads to more promising candidates.

            Decorative image of hands interlockedGet Everyone Involved

            Record applicant interviews and share the most promising candidates with key colleagues to ensure correct hiring decisions are made. It also helps calibrate the recruiting team—in much the same way as your quality assurance teams are calibrated—so that each candidate is evaluated consistently.

            Decorative image of crystal ballUse Your Crystal Ball (Sort Of)

            It takes a lot of time and money hiring each new agent, which is wasted if the new hire doesn’t work out. Big data and predictive analytics can help identify stellar candidates and minimize the risk of a bad hire. Predictive analytics compares the tenure and performance of successful agents with data collected about them during their hiring process. This comparison gives you a data-driven model that can help you evaluate new applicants. If candidates fit the model, they generally perform well against the key metrics of the organization. Move them to the top of your list for hiring consideration.
            Step Three: Keep Your Agents Motivated

            Customer service agent works at her desk.

            So you’ve found the right talent, and built your team. Now you’ve arrived at one of the most important steps of all: Invest in your employees. Rewarding agents when they go beyond their job description helps retain top talent.

            Remember, happy agents = happy customers. To keep your agents happy, you’ve got to equip them with tools to succeed in their job. Agents who feel supported are more invested in their jobs, and they’re more proactive, productive, and most importantly, more pleasant to customers.

            So where to start? According to David Bethers, “fun incentive programs are an easy way to motivate and build team collaboration, while making employees feel rewarded for a job well done. But you also need a plan. These five ways can help agents make a successful career out of customer service.”

                New skills: Offer training in digital, social media, and mobile apps and emerging channels.
                New motivations: Empower agents to make decisions, highlight agent diversity hiring practices.
                New work rules: Give high-performing agents more autonomy that can lead to future positions, offer schedule flexibility, and encourage collaboration within the team.
                New metrics: Take another look at agent retention, offer role extensions and paths to promotions.
                New career paths: Introduce opportunities for agents to migrate to another department in your organization, such as Marketing, Digital Content, Social Media, or Sales.

            Step Four: Deliver Constructive Feedback on Agent Performance

            There are lots of factors that can affect an agent’s performance. As we all know, the contact center can be a stressful place. Agent stress can trigger customer stress, and customer stress can trigger agent stress. If you see an issue escalating on the floor, be sure to talk to your agents to help them recognize and diffuse their stress triggers.

            Next, be sure to design the performance conversations in advance and communicate with your agents about how they are assessed. Create an open dialogue established to understand what tools and continued training your agents require to perform at their best.

            Finally, deliver constructive and consistent feedback designed to improve agent performance and be clear about how you can support them and their growth aspirations. These steps can go far to ensure that agents earn your respect and trust and that they’re set up for continued success within your organization.

            Scoping Rules Enhancements

            Scoping Rules help end-users focus on the records that are relevant to their job. In wealth management, for example, sales associates have access to far too many records since they support multiple financial advisors and teams. With Scoping Rules, the sales associate can choose a "scope," and limit the records they can see to increase productivity. Scoping rules are far more flexible than just wealth management, and can be used as a replacement for Divisions (Classic only) or other scenarios where users may need to focus on a specific brand, department, branch, or other grouping.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe key features of the Flosum platform structure.
                Identify the typical steps of the development flow within the Flosum platform.

            Flosum’s Platform Structure

            Salesforce admins and developers know that finding a tool that helps them manage changes across the entire development lifecycle is no easy task. Many DevSecOps (development, security, operations) tools are siloed, which makes visibility and collaboration between teams a real struggle. And still others are not suited for the unique needs of the Salesforce Platform. 

            To deliver speedy, secure, and successful Salesforce releases, companies need a solution that streamlines processes, helps them quickly and easily identify and remedy code issues, keeps orgs in sync, and protects and preserves the integrity of customer data. 

            Flosum is a complete, end-to-end solution for Salesforce DevSecOps that allows developers and operations teams to orchestrate changes throughout the development lifecycle. Because it’s built on Salesforce and uses the Salesforce interface, Flosum doesn’t need to access or move data elsewhere. 

            The Flosum platform offers user-story management, built-in merge tools, version control, continuous deployments, static code analysis, regression-testing solutions, and more. 

            Let’s explore Flosum’s structure through the elements of its navigation.  

            Navigation Tab
            	

            Functionality

            Home Tab
            	

            Displays the Kanban board and SwimLanes, which let users track all stories, branches, and components; users can define and track promotion paths and manage all their work at the organizational level.

            Orgs Tab
            	

            Shows users the various orgs that are connected to Flosum, the high-level details of changes that have been made or deployed in each org, code coverage, the audit trail for each org, and more

            Comparison Tab
            	

            Lets users compare different orgs to each other or compare an org to a branch or even to a repository or source

            Branches, Source, and Commits Tabs 
            	

            Give users access to the native version control functionality built entirely within Flosum, which they can use independently or integrate with other version control systems

            Peer Reviews Tab
            	

            Allows users to merge the code of different branches and facilitate a peer code review 

            Pipelines Tab
            	

            Lets users define pipelines to automate and execute each step of the development process as code gets deployed upstream, or use pipelines for back promotions 

            SwimLanes Tab
            	

            Lets users view SwimLanes in the Kanban board

            Dashboard Tab
            	

            Gives users the ability to view all of the reports, dashboards, and key performance indicator (KPI) metrics for the platform stored within Salesforce custom objects; users can use standard reporting or manipulate their reporting with another tool such as Salesforce CRM Analytics to reflect their business needs. 

            Settings Tab
            	

            Allows users to control all of the settings in the Flosum platform (system admins only)

            Flosum also helps teams connect all of their sandboxes, test orgs, and production environments to create a super-smooth development flow. Let’s get into it.
            Flosum’s Development Flow

            Ready to go with the flow? Here are the basic steps of development that the developer completes using the Flosum platform:

                Creates a branch.
                Commits components to the branch.
                Ties a user story to the branch.
                Makes a request for peer code review.
                Merges the various branches into a release branch.
                Uses Overwrite Protection to review and resolve any merge conflicts.
                Deploys the release branch to testing orgs and then to production.
                Commits their changes to the Flosum repository. The Flosum platform automatically deploys those changes to the production org and back-deploys to all sandboxes so that they remain in sync.

            Note

            This flow represents the “best practice” for development; keep in mind that the Flosum platform is flexible, so teams can use it in many ways and adapt it to their needs.

            Now that you’re familiar with the platform’s features and flow, it’s time to break down the first six development steps. Head on over to the next unit to prepare for deployment.

            Creating a Branch

            In Flosum, a branch is an independent line of development that allows developers and Salesforce administrators to work in parallel with other team members while keeping their changes separate from the rest of the team’s changes. 

            A branch is a separate part of—but connected to—a developer’s repository. A repository can contain multiple branches, and these branches can be merged into the repository when necessary.

            Flosum supports many types of branches, including:

                Feature branches: A feature branch consists of a user story containing each of the features being developed for that user story. (One feature per feature branch is recommended.)
                Release branches: After the feature branches move through quality assurance (QA), they are merged into a release branch. A release branch will hold the various feature branches until they’re ready to be pushed to production.

            Committing Components and Tying a User Story to a Branch

            After a developer has created a branch and tied a user story to the branch, they can modify the components in a development sandbox and add those components to a particular branch. 

            Flosum automatically detects the components that have been changed in the development sandbox and shows the details of each component, when it was changed, who changed it, the component type, and the component’s name. 

            Users have the option to filter and select components by type and to search components by name. (Flosum supports all component types that Salesforce supports, whether it’s metadata API or tooling API.)

            Note

            At this point in the flow, Flosum will run a code quality scan. Read more about this process here. 

            Once a developer is assigned a user story, they can tie it to a branch in Flosum using Jira, ServiceNow, Azure DevOps, or another application lifecycle management (ALM) tool. For example, the user could search for a Jira ticket within the branch and append it to the branch. 
            Making a Request for Peer Code Review

            When a developer submits a request, they’re asking that one or more of their team members complete a code review of a branch. 

            Developers should ask for a code review before merging into shared branches, deploying to an org, or committing code to a repository. Making requests for peer code review:

                Increases communication among team members who are working on shared components.
                Informs team members about changes that have occurred.
                Results in higher quality deployments.

            Merging Branches

            The next step is merging the various user stories or branches that each developer is working on into a release branch. When a user merges branches, Flosum will show the conflicts between both branches or user stories that the user is choosing to merge. The user is then able to resolve the conflicts.  
            Using Overwrite Protection

            With the Overwrite Protection feature (formerly known as “Impact Analysis”), users can compare their deployments and their target orgs to detect and resolve code conflicts. The main purpose of this feature is to prevent any changes on the org from being overwritten unintentionally. 

            Users can complete these predeployment operations efficiently through Flosum platform’s seamless integration with Salesforce. Now we’re ready to dive into deployment. You’ll learn all about it in the next unit.

            Deploy a Release Branch to Production
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe deploying a release branch.
                Identify how pipelines automate development processes.
                Summarize how users track and manage the dev process with the Kanban board and SwimLanes.

            Deploying a Release Branch

            All deployments are done from the branch records within Flosum. A user can deploy a release branch in one of two ways:

                Manually: Users execute a standard deployment where they select the org and push the components out to the org.
                Via Pipelines: Users configure the steps ahead of time and execute them automatically. (We will discuss more about this later.)

            When a user attempts to execute a deployment, it shows the deployment history at the top of the Deploy tab. 

            The Flosum Deploy tab

            There, users can see:

                The deployment name.
                The changes that have been made.
                Destructive changes (the removal of components from an org).

            Users also can view the metadata logs of deployment, including:

                How many components were successfully deployed.
                Which components passed.
                Which components failed.

            Under other tabs within Deploy, users can see the following information and more:

                Which Jira stories were deployed (Jira)
                Who approved them (Approval History)
                Which components were changed (Manifest)

            Note

            After a developer commits their changes to the Flosum repository, the Flosum platform automatically deploys those changes to the production org and back-deploys to all sandboxes so they remain in sync. 
            Using Pipelines

            A pipeline allows a user to define and automate the exact series of steps they want executed in the development process. 

            Users can automate four different actions:

                Validations
                Deployments
                Rollbacks
                Webhook calls

            Pipelines perform these actions in a series of steps, and include dependent steps based on whether the preceding action has passed or failed. Pipelines also let users select the tests they want to run (for example, specified tests, included tests, or all test options).

            Let’s look at an example. Suppose a user has a feature branch that has been approved and is going to use a pipeline to deploy into the integrated development environment (IDE). If the validation is successful, it will deploy to the QA org. If the deployment is successful, it will complete the regression testing on the QA org. If the regression testing is successful, it will take that particular branch and promote it to the production org. If a deployment fails at any point along the way, it does not proceed to the next step. 
            Tracking and Managing the Development Process

            The Kanban board on the Flosum Home tab shows where each user story sits in the development process in real time.

            The Flosum Home tab

            Before You Start

            Before you start this module, consider completing the following recommended content.

                Programs and Benefits in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs 

            Increase Insights and Impact

            When you report on your mission, you likely report high-level totals: the number of people served by a program or the amount of a particular benefit you delivered in a year.

            As you know, those high-level numbers are made up of many small moments. Each class your team leads, every one-on-one counseling session, every meal distributed—it all adds up.

            In this module, you learn about those individual events, which are recorded as benefit disbursement records in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs.

            A nonprofit distributes meals after a natural disaster

            Nonprofit Cloud for Programs is an integrated Salesforce platform solution to give you the insights, collaboration, and efficiency tools to increase your impact. It helps nonprofit organizations like yours define, plan, deliver, and track programs and the benefits they provide—then connect the dots to make real-time decisions about how to improve your work.

            In this unit, we start by discussing some of those dots: The objects and records you use to track your work.
            Understand Schedules and Ad Hoc Benefit Deliveries

            The highest-level data in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs are program records, which track the thematic areas of your work. Each program can have many related benefit records, which track what your nonprofit provides to participants and recipients. If you haven’t set up your programs and benefits, start with the Programs and Benefits in Nonprofit Cloud for Programs badge.

            To track a program participant’s eligibility for benefits—like 12 classes or 5 hours of counseling—you use benefit assignment records to account for your benefit disbursements.

            Then, when you provide those benefits, you track that activity with a benefit disbursement record. Benefit disbursements store information about a service, like when it was provided and how much was given. You can measure your benefit disbursements in time, money, goods, or some other criteria.

            You’ll likely create many, many benefit disbursement records. So, Nonprofit Cloud for Programs helps you create and manage benefit disbursements in two ways: by scheduling them in advance and by creating them as needed when they occur.

            You use benefit schedule records to create disbursements for planned sessions. A benefit schedule helps you create one or more benefit sessions, to which you can add participants, track attendance, and efficiently create benefit disbursement records.

            A schedule can be one-time, recurring on a regular schedule, or include many sessions scheduled irregularly. When you create a benefit schedule, a benefit session record is automatically created for every occurrence in the benefit schedule if it’s recurring.

            If you offer a benefit that doesn’t have planned participation—such as a walk-in service or disaster relief—you can create ad-hoc benefit disbursements as needed. You review all of these different scenarios in this module.
            Want to Get Hands-on with Nonprofit Cloud?

            In this module, we show you the steps to manage attendance and benefit disbursements in Nonprofit Cloud. We don’t have any hands-on challenges in this module, but if you want to practice and try out the steps, register for a free Nonprofit Cloud trial org with sample data. A regular Trailhead Playground doesn’t have Nonprofit Cloud or our sample data. Here’s how to get the free trial edition now.

                Sign up for a free 30-day Nonprofit Cloud trial org.
                Fill out the form.
                Click Submit. A confirmation message appears.
                When you receive the activation email (this might take a few minutes), open it and click Verify Account.
                Complete your registration by setting your password and challenge question. Tip: Save your username, password, and login URL in a secure place—such as a password manager—for easy access later. 

            Your Nonprofit Cloud trial org is ready.
            Enroll a Program Participant

            First, you must know how to enroll a participant in a program. You track this relationship with the Program Enrollment object. 

            Note

            If you work with individuals, you might call the people you serve clients, students, guests, or something more specific. You might also serve animals or other organizations. We use the term participant here to refer to anyone—or anything—enrolled in your programs and benefits. We use the term recipient for those people who receive a benefit but aren't enrolled, such as an anonymous recipient.

            Program enrollments can be related to either contact or account records by default. Your person accounts for individuals appear in list views and search as both contacts and accounts, and organizations appear as only accounts. See Stakeholder Management in Nonprofit Cloud in Trailhead for details about person accounts.

            In this badge, you follow along with Hunger No More International (HNMI), a nonprofit working to end hunger and promote healthy food options globally by providing access to nutritious meals, education, and resources. You complete the same steps as Luke Richardson, an HNMI program manager for the organization’s nutrition education work who ensures that program’s effectiveness.

            Luke starts by adding a participant to one of HNMI’s programs by creating a program enrollment record. This example follows the standard process—yours may be different depending on what’s required to enroll a participant in a particular program. Work with your admin to create a custom enrollment process to fit your needs.

                Find and select Program Management from the App Launcher (https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/attendance-and-benefit-tracking-in-nonprofit-cloud-for-programs/get-to-know-enrollments-and-deliveries/images/7f466b2024fe866364fcf6479295829a_kix.irhs15to6v1.jpg).
                Select the All Programs list view.
                Select the Nutrition Education program from the list view.
                Click Add Participants.
                In the flow, select Contacts to add person accounts to the program. You can also select a list view to further filter the results.
                https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/attendance-and-benefit-tracking-in-nonprofit-cloud-for-programs/get-to-know-enrollments-and-deliveries/images/45d3e0d12e4fdf0107da5ed704ba7810_kix.qhxa6vd4fg1.jpg
                Find and select participants from the list. You can add as many as 20 participants to a program at once. Select Alex Brown.
                Save your work. 

            A program enrollment record for the Nutrition Education program

            If your organization wants to track a set of participants as they move through a program together—such as everyone who starts a program in a particular month—group their program enrollments using the Program Cohort object. See Manage Program Cohorts and Cohort Members in Salesforce Help for details.

            Now that you know about the objects you use and have enrolled a program participant, you can dive in to benefit disbursements and benefit schedules in the next unit.

            Get Started with Einstein Generative AI
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe the core capabilities of generative AI.
                Describe how Einstein incorporates the power of generative AI. 

            AI in the Spotlight

            Over the past decade we've witnessed artificial intelligence (AI) steadily improve at doing things we once thought only humans could do. This has led us to imagine a futuristic world with AI, but one that's still years away. Or so we thought. In early 2023 ChatGPT burst onto the scene, showing the world that the future is already here. Suddenly, AI is responding to complex questions with equally complex answers that sound as if they were written by a human. And because ChatGPT was released for anyone to use, people experienced first-hand how well it could hold a natural-sounding conversation. It has surprised and delighted, and sparked our imaginations yet again. It’s also raised questions about what it means for the future of work.

            In this Quick Look badge, you learn about GPT and how it fits into the larger concept of generative AI. Then, you'll learn how Einstein is the world’s first generative AI for CRM.
            GPT’s Predictive Power

            Okay, let's get this out of the way: GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which means a lot to AI researchers but not so much to you and me. Let's just stick with GPT and focus on what it does.

            At a high level, GPT is an AI tool that has been trained to write like we humans do. All it needs is a starting point in the form of a question, request, or even just the beginning of a sentence. And then it continues the thread to create paragraphs of text that are similar to something a real person would write. ChatGPT is a version of GPT that has been fine-tuned to better understand the intention of our instructions, and respond accordingly. You can even tell it to write in a certain style, whether it's poetry, a programming language, or as a pirate. For example, let's see what happens when you ask it to summarize the moon landing in pirate-speak:

            "Ahoy there! Avast ye, matey! 'Tis a tale o' adventure on the high seas o' space!

            Back in the year o' our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, a band o' brave sailors from the land o' America set sail on a quest to reach the moon. They be Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, and they be on a mission from NASA to land on the moon and plant the stars and stripes flag."

            It continues from there, completing the tale in the same silly vernacular.

            So how does it generate such convincing text? OpenAI, the creators of GPT, used a ridiculous amount of computing power to train it. They had it read millions of web pages to learn what words are used near each other, and how they're used together. That made GPT really good at predicting the next word of a sentence by using context. So, imagine you're asked to fill in the blank: "In conversations, my partner and I finish each other's _______." You're likely to choose the word "sentences," and so is GPT. But if you change the context a little: "In restaurants, my partner and I finish each other's _______." There's a better chance you would fill the blank with "sandwiches." Same with GPT.

            GPT writes paragraphs that follow a thread by making an educated guess at each new word in a sentence. It's way better than your phone's predictive text, which if used in the same way only gives you bizarre sentences that make for funny internet memes.

            GPT's ability to write coherent text falls into a broader category of AI known as generative AI. This includes AI tools that can create things like images or audio. As computing power increases, and research continues, generative AI will get better at creating work that’s convincingly human-made. It probably won’t be long before generative AI is part of your everyday life.
            A Future with Generative AI

            The arrival of mainstream generative AI has raised a lot of questions about the future of work. People wonder if they'll be replaced with AI. They're concerned about the ethical use of a tool that essentially impersonates humans. They’re skeptical about the quality of what generative AI produces. Obviously, AI must be handled with care.

            Salesforce knows it's critical to establish principles for the ethical use of AI technology. And for the last 6 years, we've had an AI ethics group developing these principles. So when we launch new AI technology, we can help our customers navigate these difficult waters to do the business of business smarter and fairer. Check out the resources section to learn more.

            Our latest AI technology brings the incredible power of generative AI to Einstein and the Salesforce Platform.

            Einstein is built right into Salesforce, so it can use your own data to custom-tailor everything it generates to your unique business. And since Einstein is available across the entire Einstein 1 platform, it's there to improve every customer experience.

            We also recognize that the world of generative AI includes more than just ChatGPT. So we've designed Einstein to allow connections to other language models, such as Anthropic's Claude. This lets you "bring your own model" thanks to APIs and an open ecosystem of generative AI partners.

            Einstein is here to empower your business with amazing generative AI capabilities, using your data and your models for your experiences.

            Get to Know Cybersecurity Risk Management
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe the goals of a cybersecurity risk management program.
                Explain the importance of managing cybersecurity risks. 

            What Is Cybersecurity Risk Management?

            Your company just closed a deal to use a new cloud computing service. Whoopee! This new technology makes it easier to automate application development and bring new opportunities. But let’s pause for a moment. Have you considered the potential impact if the data processed by this new technology is compromised by an attacker? Have you thought about the risks?

            This is where cybersecurity risk management comes into play. Cybersecurity risk management is the process of managing risks associated with digital business assets. It involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization’s assets. As a cybersecurity risk manager you strive to improve visibility into risks at the enterprise, business unit, and system-level, in order to strengthen an organization’s cyber resilience. Cyber resilience refers to an organization’s ability to prevent, detect, respond, and recover from cyber threats. In a world of constant change, new cyber risks and threats arise daily. You enable their organization to respond to events in a timely way, in order to minimize business disruption and financial losses. Suffice to say, it’s a pretty important role!

            So, going back to our example at the beginning, how do you, as a cyber risk manager, identify the risks of using the new cloud computing service? To begin with, you need to consider the likelihood that known threats exploit vulnerabilities. For example, is there sensitive customer data stored in the cloud that an attacker would be interested in stealing? Are there known vulnerabilities in the applications running in the cloud that would allow an attacker to access the information? What is the potential financial, operational, and reputational impact on your company if such a breach occurs? How likely is it that this scenario actually happens? These are the types of questions a risk manager thinks about every day.

            Note

            A vulnerability is defined as the state of being exposed to the possibility of attack. In cybersecurity this can be a flaw in an application’s code that lets an attacker change the behavior of the application and steal sensitive information.

            Once the risk of a certain program, system, or technology is identified, the organization takes actions to protect itself from the risk. Imagine you are buying health insurance. When you have health insurance, you do not have to worry as much about the cost of your healthcare bills. If you have an accident, you know you can get good quality care and recover quickly. When you choose your insurance plan, you carefully consider the benefits and costs of each plan in order to decide on the one that best suits your healthcare needs. In the same way, as a cybersecurity risk manager, you compare the costs and benefits of mitigating cyber risk by implementing protections, and advising the organization to implement the best action plan.

            Image of a person comparing two healthcare plans surrounded by tools for managing risk, such as a calculator, money, stethoscope, thermometer, pills, and a prescription.

            Just like purchasing insurance reduces the risk associated with accidents, managing cyber risk “buys down” the potential impact if data is compromised by an attacker. Although it’s impossible to fully eliminate all risk, managing cyber risk minimizes the likelihood that an attacker can exploit a vulnerability. If an attacker is successful in breaching a system, risk management can still minimize business disruption and financial losses, so the organization can get back to business faster. 
            The Importance of Managing Cyber Risks

            As your organization acquires new technology assets and becomes ever more connected, the threats to your customer’s and your business’ data expand as well. It’s time to put a plan in place to deliver the right amount of cyber protections, so your customers know that they can trust your organization to secure their information. Managing cyber risks means making conscious decisions about securing sensitive information.

            As a cyber risk manager, you work to make risk identification and evaluation easier, so everyone, from your boss to your customers, understands the organization’s tolerance for risk, and the actions and associated costs necessary to manage it. Although managing cybersecurity risk can’t ensure that you always make the correct decisions, it does ensure that everyone understands who is responsible for managing a given risk to acceptable levels.

            Every organization is unique when it comes to risk and how much it’s willing to take on. But managing cyber risks is an activity that is important for small and large organizations, around the world in every industry, from finance to healthcare to government to energy. Smaller companies may outsource risk management functions to a third party. You may be in charge of working with one of these vendors. Or you may even work for a company that sells cybersecurity risk management services. As a member of the cyber risk management team in a larger organization, you may need to work with many teams across the enterprise to holistically understand risk, including integrating with the Enterprise Risk Management Team. This team manages the organization’s financial, operational, legal, and other risks, in addition to cybersecurity risks at a strategic, enterprise level.

            Cybersecurity Risk Manager Responsibilities

            Are you a great analyzer, influencer, and problem solver? Do you enjoy understanding threats and analyzing data to better understand risk? Do you like to come up with action-oriented improvement plans? If so, managing cybersecurity risks can be the perfect job for you!

            Let’s meet David. He is a cybersecurity risk manager at a cybersecurity services company. David identifies and analyzes risks facing the organization and its systems, and then he prioritizes the most likely and impactful cybersecurity risks. He understands threats and challenges facing the organization, and gathers and uses data to assess risks to the business. His goal is to enable business system owners, executives, and other stakeholders to make risk-informed decisions to manage risks at an acceptable level.

            David has a challenging but pivotal role. It’s his job to try to mitigate risks by working with key stakeholders and leadership to lessen the likelihood and impact of a given risk. 

            In doing so, David has to balance risks and rewards, much like someone carefully balances while walking across a tightrope. His company faces many threats to its valuable systems and data, such as denial of service attacks from malicious actors who want to overwhelm his servers so that his customers cannot access them. He also has a limited amount of financial, staff, and technological resources to address the risks posed by these threats. Once he has worked with partners to identify the most likely and highly impactful risks, it’s his job to help the organization prioritize risks in a logical way. 

            A person balances on a tightrope using a pole with a scale holding a shield on one end, and a vulnerability bug on the other.

            David likes understanding how all the pieces of the risk puzzle in his organization fit together. He researches frameworks applicable to his given industry and uses them to assess the current protections and provide opportunities for improvements, in order to manage risks to an acceptable level. He also works with teams across the business to help them improve their risk posture. He makes sure each part of the organization understands its role in managing risk. Once he and his partners have assessed their risk and current protections, he advises system owners on the implementation of technical controls to help mitigate risk, and documents risk decisions for the organization. 

            Note

            As a risk manager you are not responsible for implementing technical controls yourself, or for eliminating all risks facing the enterprise. Rather you work with system owners to prioritize high impact, likely risks for remediation and advise on mitigation strategies. 

            David is like a detective who constantly searches for clues about the current risk posture of his company. Once mitigations have been put in place, he gathers data to help monitor the organization’s risk posture, and forms close relationships across the business to validate and assess the risk posture accurately. He has his finger on the pulse of the organization's risk posture at any given moment, and recognizes problems early. His work is never done, and he evolves his strategy for managing risk as the threat and technology landscapes evolve. 
            Cybersecurity Risk Manager Skills

            So, like David, you’re ready to understand the threats against organizations and figure out how to thwart them in order to buy-down risk. What skills do you need to land your dream job? 

            First, it helps to have a bachelor’s degree. Your degree doesn’t have to be in a specific area, but risk managers often have an educational background in computers, information science, engineering, systems analysis, information technology, cybersecurity, or even accounting. There are also certifications you can pursue to bolster your security skills, including the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Information Security Manager (CISM), or Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) certifications, to name a few. 

            In terms of technical skills, as a cybersecurity risk manager you are a great analyzer, who understands cybersecurity and technology, systems management, and project management. You have skills in quantitative and qualitative data analysis, threat modeling, and scenario analysis. Risk modeling is another great skill to have, even if you’ve practiced it in another industry, such as finance.

            Technical skills help you as a risk manager understand and solve security problems, but you must also have business know-how. You use your influence and persuasion skills to advise on decisions with significant organizational impact. You are a great communicator who enjoys collaborating to get things done and advocate for security best practices. You like building trust and consensus across organizational teams, and you are both detail-oriented and think strategically to solve problems. 

            Finally, as a cybersecurity risk manager, you have a passion for researching, analyzing, and applying different regulatory and policy frameworks to help your organization meet industry standards in an efficient manner. Some of the most common frameworks you should be familiar with are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, and ISO/IEC 27001/2 Information Technology standards, although there are many more to learn about!

            Before You Start

            If you completed Get Started with Application Security, then you already know how to protect networks and prevent network attacks. Now let’s talk about how to use a web application firewall (WAF) to defend your application perimeter from malicious traffic. 
            What Is WAF Security?

            According to Cloudflare, a WAF creates a shield between a web application and the internet; this shield can help mitigate many common attacks. It helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic between a web application and the internet.

            Just as a tollbooth allows paying customers to drive across a toll road, and prevents nonpaying customers from accessing the roadway, network traffic must pass through a firewall, before it’s allowed to reach a server. WAFs use adaptable policies to defend against vulnerabilities in a web application, allowing for easy policy modification, and faster response to new attack vectors. 

            A toll booth on a highway allows paying cars through and blocks nonpaying cars.

            A WAF defends applications from malicious traffic. While other security solutions, such as traditional firewalls, mostly work based on ports and protocols, a WAF has to understand and examine the application layer traffic. A WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as:

                Cross-site request forgery (CSRF): Also known as Sea Surf or Session Riding, this is an attack vector that tricks a web browser into executing unwanted actions in applications logged into by the user. This attack can result in unauthorized fund transfers, changed passwords, and data theft.
                Cross-site scripting (XSS): An attack that tricks a web browser into running malicious code. That malicious code can be inserted in several ways. Often, it is either added to the end of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or posted directly onto a page that displays user-generated content.
                File inclusion: An attack technique in which hackers trick a web application into running or exposing files on a server. If this occurs, sensitive information could be exposed and in some cases lead to XSS and other damaging attacks.
                Structured Query Language (SQL) injection: An attack that surfaces as a result of malicious code being plugged into an unsuspecting database. With this technique attackers can access information that was not intended to be seen by the public, such as private customer details or company data, which is highly detrimental toward a business’s interests.
                Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): An attack that disrupts normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic. It uses multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

            A WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic. The value of a WAF comes in part from the speed and ease with which application security engineers can implement policy modification, allowing for faster response to the above attack types.

            In other words, a WAF is one of the tools responsible for securing business-critical web apps from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10, zero-day threats, known or unknown application vulnerabilities, and an array of other web application layer attacks that can impact your organization.

            As organizations undergo new digital initiatives, their attack surface may expand as they enable new business. As a result, they often find that new web applications and application programming interfaces (APIs) become exposed to dangerous traffic due to web server vulnerabilities, a server plugin, or other issues exploited by threats that aim to disrupt organizations. WAFs help to keep these applications and the content they access secure.
            Why WAFs Are Critical for Organizations

            Organizations increasingly use web application technologies as part of digital innovation (DI) efforts. As a result, organizations require a fundamental change in the way they conduct business using digital technology. DI means that you have more web applications touching more critical and sensitive data. Organizations that can protect their web applications can move faster, and can put new capabilities into the hands of their users more quickly, and more securely.

            For organizations to successfully implement DI efforts, they need to do more than simply deploy technologies. They also need to focus on the needs of customers, and be willing to embrace rapid change, including rapid adoption and technology deployment options to meet the needs of customers.

            Organizations can use public cloud and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions to accelerate their businesses, but they must protect them with strict security rules. As organizations rapidly adopt these technologies, the speed of business operations also increases, and web application security flaws arise, leaving web applications at risk from threats hiding in internet traffic.

            As customers increasingly access business applications using unknown bring your own devices (BYOD) on networks that are not controlled with virtual private network (VPN) access, organizations should recognize the risks. Even network firewalls can be vulnerable. Traditional perimeter application security tools are not adequate for protecting internet-facing applications from OWASP Top 10 dangers and other application vulnerabilities found in network traffic.

            Organizations need a new set of rules and tools to defend business-critical applications– WAF is a solution that protects these applications and data.
            What Types of Threats Do WAFs Prevent?

            Modern web applications require a comprehensive WAF to protect important applications against multiple types of web attacks and other threats lurking in network traffic. 

            The OWASP Top 10 “represents a broad consensus about the most critical application security threats to web applications.” Attackers often leverage these threats to target critical network appliances. The OWASP Top 10 includes:

            Top 10 Web Application Security Risks
            	

            Description

            1. Broken access control
            	

            When user access and restrictions are not enforced, unauthorized users can potentially access confidential files.

            2. Cryptographic failures
            	

            Since many web applications and APIs lack data security, attackers can exploit sensitive financial, healthcare, and personal information.

            3. Injection
            	

            When untrusted data is sent to an interpreter, an attacker can inject malicious code. What’s more, when an application includes untrusted data without validation, cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws occur that can be used to perform attacks.

            4. Insecure Design
            	

            Risks exist related to design flaws. These can be mitigated using threat modeling, secure design patterns and principles, and reference architectures.

            5. Security misconfiguration
            	

            Many legacy Extensible Markup Language (XML) processors evaluate extremal entities, which can be leveraged to disclose internal files. What’s more, default or ad-hoc configurations can lead to security misconfigurations that lead to vulnerabilities.

            6. Vulnerable and outdated components
            	

            Components often run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerability occurs, all components and applications can be compromised.

            7. Identification and authentication failures
            	

            If authentication mechanisms are not implemented properly, attackers can expose these vulnerabilities

            8. Software and data integrity failures
            	

            These failures can lead to remote code execution which can be used to perform attacks.

            9. Security logging and monitoring failures
            	

            Logging and monitoring that does not integrate with an incident response technology creates insufficient protection processes.

            10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
            	

            Allows an attacker to induce the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location. This can result in unauthorized actions or access to data within an organization, either in the vulnerable application itself or on other back-end systems that the application can communicate with.

            However, taking the OWASP Top 10 into consideration is just the beginning. OWASP describes the Top 10 as a list of the most pervasive risks that organizations should consider. Modern WAF security must go further to address risks outside the scope of the OWASP Top 10, including the following.

            Risk
            	

            Description

            Bots
            	

            Bots are programs that interact with your applications and often mimic human interaction. Good bots may be allowed to interact with an application, and include: search engines, virtual assistants, and content aggregators (for example., price comparison sites). Bad bot activity can include: web scraping, competitive data mining, personal and financial data harvesting, account takeover and transaction fraud.

            Malicious uploads
            	

            Many web applications allow users to upload their own content, which can include a variety of malicious code payloads.

            Unknown vulnerabilities
            	

            Signature-based solutions cannot protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities. A robust WAF solution must be able to defend against threats for which no signatures exist.

            Zero-day attacks
            	

            Zero-day attacks target previously unknown flaws in an application. When a threat actor discovers a zero-day vulnerability, they can use it to exploit systems that do not have additional defensive measures in place, such as a WAF.

            Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
            	

            In a DDoS attack, attackers use a large number of systems, often a botnet of compromised computers, to overwhelm an application so that it cannot respond to legitimate user requests. Using DDoS attacks, attackers can attempt to simply overwhelm the system with traffic or may attempt to exploit a flaw in the application logic to achieve the same result.
            Sum It Up

            Learn How Web Application Firewalls Protect APIs
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Identify how web application firewalls (WAFs) deliver application programming interface (API) protection.
                List how WAFs help organizations meet compliance rules.
                Define how advanced WAF capabilities can help your organization protect data from modern threats.
                Describe how to choose a WAF product.

            How WAFs Deliver API Protection

            The days of basic websites serving up simple Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) pages have passed. Traffic has become more sophisticated. Web applications today deliver mission-critical services using APIs that provide richer, more responsive experiences by letting the client process raw data instead of just rendering simple HTML.

            These API tools also support the mobile applications that users in the community need to access. When the client has access to a large amount of application data, the impact of an attacker exploiting the API's rules when a WAF isn't in place can be significant. These tools require a WAF to ensure they are protected from OWASP Top 10 threats. WAFs can protect against file inclusion vulnerabilities and others seeking to take advantage of internet traffic, a server plugin, or other vulnerabilities.

            Note

            Not all WAFs have API security capabilities. The addition of API capabilities is how WAFs evolve to web application and API protection (WAAP).

            A traditional web application makes a get request to a server, and the browser renders HTML. API-based applications rely on more powerful clients to process raw data.
            WAFs for Compliance

            Making the data that web applications rely on available to the application often comes with compliance obligations. WAFs help organizations meet compliance rules as well. Regardless of your service provider, compliance needs to be your primary priority.

            Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), for example, defines a set of application security standards that organizations handling credit cards must comply with. PCI 6.6 specifically will often come up when discussing web application firewall technologies designed to keep traffic and assets secure. The standard requires inspection of traffic to web applications that interact with card data. To comply with the standard, organizations have two options.

                Web application code reviews (which can slow down deployments)
                Deploying WAFs between the client and the web application.

            In a world where organizations are expected to frequently and rapidly deploy code changes as they adopt software development and IT operations (DevOps) methodologies, a robust WAF will often be a better solution for meeting these types of compliance rules while protecting the organization from OWASP Top 10 threats.
            Advanced Capabilities of Web Application Firewalls

            Let’s take a look at some advanced WAF capabilities, such as machine learning, for delivering both accurate detection and reduced management overhead.

            Machine Learning

            Traditional web application learning techniques require manual tuning and are prone to false positives. Tuning applications every time there is a change and remediating false positives drives up administrative overhead for teams and others in the organization's community that may already be overburdened.

            WAFs can use machine learning to update their protection model automatically as the web application evolves. This means application security teams and others in the IT department spend less time manually tuning the web application firewalls according to traffic and creating exceptions based on false positives.

            Advanced Reporting

            WAFs can provide organizations full visibility into event details. They can generate attack logs that include the critical information that security operations center (SOC) analysts need, such as the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) body information, and clear indications on why security rules require an application request to be blocked.
            Choosing a WAF Product

            In choosing a WAF product, organizations should look for one that includes the following capabilities. 

                Backed by threat intelligence
                OWASP Top 10 protection
                API WAF management
                Bot mitigation
                DDoS protection
                File protection
                Information leak prevention
                Cross site request forgery (CSRF) protection
                Web socket security
                API security

            You should also consider the infrastructure used to deliver the WAF, whether it can be easily integrated with your sandbox and other security solutions, whether it includes a content delivery network (CDN), and whether its attack logs can be easily exported to your external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe the goals of cybersecurity compliance analysis.
                Explain the importance of cybersecurity compliance analysis. 

            What Is Cybersecurity Compliance?

            Cybersecurity trailblazers make security intrinsic to their business. There’s a rising and enormous cost associated with data breaches, a trend that’s driving the need for more robust cybersecurity strategies. According to a report by Accenture, in their annual survey among 4,744 global respondents around the current state of cybersecurity resilience, about one-third of all respondents say poor governance and compliance is a problem.

            To help protect businesses and consumers from these breaches, governments, regulators, and organizations put in place laws, regulations, standards, and policies that address issues of cybersecurity and data protection. If your business collects, stores, or uses sensitive information, then failure to comply with these mandates can have a profound impact on your business processes. A data breach can lead to a significant financial loss, market share value loss, as well as costs spent on compensating affected customers. 

            In general, compliance is defined as following rules and meeting requirements. In cybersecurity, compliance means creating and maintaining a program that establishes risk-based controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of information stored, processed, or transferred. These controls are used to demonstrate adherence to the applicable compliance requirements in order to establish the necessary level of security.

            Cybersecurity compliance analysis is the process of assessing whether the behavior of an information technology (IT) system or application conforms to the cybersecurity rules and regulations in force. Effective cybersecurity compliance analysis helps you prioritize compliance risks, maps compliance risks to the applicable parts of the organization that must help address them, and effectively allocates resources to mitigate compliance risks. This analysis can be performed either by an internal team or a third party. While a business may have compliance analysts focused on other types of rules and regulations—such as standard accounting principles, medical treatment protocols, or laws against criminal activity—cybersecurity compliance involves rules and regulations specifically pertaining to protecting sensitive data by securing IT systems.

            As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, your work helps to protect sensitive information, including:

                Personally identifiable information (PII), such as first and last name, date of birth, and government-issued personal identification number (PIN).
                Protected health information (PHI), such as medical history, records of admissions, and prescription records.
                Financial data, such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and debit card PINs.
                Authenticators, including biometrics such as fingerprints, voice prints, and facial recognition data.
                Other sensitive data, such as IP addresses, email addresses, usernames, and passwords. 

            Failing to adequately screen your and your suppliers’ security for protections of this data can increase the likelihood of data breaches, which can shut down operations, damage customer trust, and incur hefty regulatory penalties. For these reasons, your analysis of the security compliance of your organization's internal and external systems must be comprehensive, efficient, and scalable.

            The Importance of Cybersecurity Compliance

            Now that we know what cybersecurity compliance is, let’s talk about why it’s important. Cybersecurity compliance helps companies, governments, and other entities process sensitive data securely. It makes sense of existing and new laws, regulations, standards, and policies to help organizations ensure they follow cybersecurity rules or guidelines. 

            Cyberattacks happen all the time, and the number and variety of attacks continues to grow, making efficient cybersecurity difficult for most organizations. With a drastic shortage in trained cybersecurity professionals, today’s environment has become increasingly challenging. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, you play a crucial role in protecting your organization from the next attack.
            Cybersecurity Risk Management vs Compliance

            It’s important to note that, while similar, cybersecurity risk management and cybersecurity compliance are not necessarily the same thing. Compliance requirements often lag behind cybersecurity risk. Simply put, it’s not enough to just be compliant with the bare minimum regulatory requirements. Your organization should also understand its cybersecurity risk posture as a whole, and put in place policies and controls to respond to these risks. In doing so, you have a crucial role to play. You must work with the cybersecurity risk managers in your organization to ensure not only compliance with applicable regulations, policies, and frameworks but also that the organization is doing its best to create a security culture that extends beyond compliance.

            A key part of this is streamlining cybersecurity efforts to be both compliant and secure, without imposing multiple, competing requirements on the business. You do so by cutting across organizational silos, aggregating information, and working with cybersecurity risk managers to provide a 360-degree view of IT risk, compliance, policy management, and vendor security practices. This enables your organization to execute and manage an effective cyber resilience strategy that both addresses compliance concerns and ensures the organization is managing cyber risk holistically without increasing the reporting burden on your teams.

            Cybersecurity compliance touches every business that needs to collect, maintain, analyze, and protect some type of sensitive data. This makes cybersecurity compliance important, no matter what industry you work in. What’s more, organizations that perform internal audits and undergo third-party audits and assessments know it plays a critical role in helping their ongoing battle of managing cyber threats. These audits and assessments provide an independent review of existing and needed controls, and help the organization understand and address the diverse risks of the digital landscape.

            Meeting or exceeding regulatory compliance standards and requirements has benefits for organizations beyond protecting sensitive data as required by law. Implementing the appropriate safeguards and security measures to protect sensitive customer and employee information bolsters your company’s security posture. This, in turn, helps to protect intellectual property such as trade secrets, software code, product specifications, and other information that gives your company a competitive advantage. 
            Sum It Up

            Now you understand more about cybersecurity compliance analysis. In the next unit, you learn more about the duties and qualifications of a cybersecurity compliance analyst, and discover the skills that help cybersecurity compliance analysts succeed.

            Discover the Skills of a Cybersecurity Compliance Analyst
            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Describe a cybersecurity compliance analyst career.
                List key skills relevant to the role of a cybersecurity compliance analyst. 

            A Cybersecurity Compliance Analyst Career

            Let’s explore whether you’d be a good fit for the role of a compliance analyst by starting with some questions.

            Who are you?

            Are you driven to make businesses more secure? Are you passionate about process improvement? Do you thrive on developing innovative insights to solve complex challenges? If you answered yes to these questions, then cybersecurity compliance analysis may be a great fit for you.

            What do you like to do?

            The work of a compliance analyst involves conducting audits and assessments, and assisting with risk management reviews and third-party assessments. In this role, your goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of an organization’s data and systems. You also work with teams across the organization to identify and mitigate cybersecurity compliance risks, and manage reporting on cybersecurity compliance to both internal and external stakeholders. You document the organization's cybersecurity compliance posture in written reports, manage compliance efforts to meet both internal and external deadlines, and help prioritize the most critical compliance gaps to be addressed first.

            What type of organization do you want to work for? 

            You might work for an advisory service firm, helping companies develop reports to demonstrate compliance with various laws, regulations, and standards. You may work in the healthcare industry, helping your organization protect patients’ protected health information (PHI) by assisting with compliance and documentation tasks. Or, you may work for the government, participating in the steps of the authorization process to ensure government systems are secure, and documenting security controls in approved templates and forms. Almost every industry that conducts digital business needs cybersecurity compliance analysts.

            When are you involved in an organization’s work? 

            When in the audit and compliance lifecycle do you get involved? You have a role to play every step of the way—from helping put in place organizational policies that ensure your systems are compliant with applicable laws and regulations, to supporting internal and third-party audits, or inspections, of systems in production to ensure that cybersecurity standards are upheld. You also contribute to security designs during system development and help to maintain a compliant system once it’s been deployed. 

            Being involved throughout the entire lifecycle of a system is key. For example, if you work at a merchant that accepts cardholder data, you may have verified during system development that your payment system satisfies the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) requirements. But if the system is then improperly deployed, or deployed in a hosting environment with other violations, you have not achieved compliance. Maintaining system controls and preventing configuration creep entails putting in place processes and measures that can be tracked and checked in real time to keep from falling out of compliance.

            How are you successful in the role? 

            How do you accomplish all of this? To give you a closer look, let’s meet Earl, a cybersecurity compliance analyst. He works at a government organization that specializes in protecting consumer financial interests by creating and enforcing consumer financial protection laws, including laws about how companies must implement cybersecurity protections to protect customer financial data. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, Earl:

                Provides guidance to help financial companies understand and comply with cybersecurity rules and statutes related to customer financial data. Some of these resources include regulatory guidance, a map of money transmission laws, and guides for financial sector executives, for example.
                Conducts examinations of how companies comply with laws related to securing customer financial data. For example, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley (GLB) Act and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)’s Safeguards Rule, financial institutions must have measures in place to keep customer information such as names, phone numbers, and credit card account numbers secure. Earl may conduct examinations of these financial institutions to verify they have a written cybersecurity plan that describes their program to protect customer information.
                Leads deep dives into systems that accept, store, process and transmit cardholder data at merchants, banks, and credit card processors to evaluate their compliance with regulations to investigate security gaps.
                Evaluates how companies’ policies stack up to regulations by analyzing documentation, roles and responsibilities, and processes to ensure systems meet security requirements.
                Assesses management and technical controls to ensure specific security compliance requirements are met. Some of these requirements include building and maintaining a secure network and systems, protecting cardholder data, and maintaining a vulnerability management program, to name a few.
                Validates the maintenance of secure configurations for systems, such as those that accept, store, process, and transmit cardholder data.
                Shares key examination findings to help organizations limit security risks and comply with laws relating to securing customer financial data.
                Works in a consultative role to help organizations securely navigate an evolving information technology (IT) environment and stay compliant with applicable laws and regulations. 

            Why should you consider this role?

            Why should you consider a cybersecurity compliance analyst career like Earl's? This is a fast-growing field in a crucial industry. As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, you work across the business, getting exposure to implementing and managing the various aspects of a security program—including perimeter defense, access control, encryption, and more. You also make a real impact in raising awareness of the potential for a data incident, and contributing to the organization’s compliance reporting. This role also has lots of room to learn and grow. Last but not least, you can earn competitive compensation. Sounds pretty great, right?
            Cybersecurity Compliance Analyst Skills

            Like Earl, you’re excited about helping organizations understand, implement, and comply with cybersecurity laws, regulations, standards, and policies. So, what education and skills do you need to pursue this career?

            Education

            It’s possible to find certain entry-level cybersecurity positions that require applicants to have a course of post-secondary study lasting 2 or 3 years. However, most jobs require a 4-year bachelor's degree in cybersecurity or a related field, such as IT or computer science, a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discipline, or business administration. 

            Cybersecurity students sit at desks; above them is an image of a computer with a lock in the middle, and behind that is a globe with 1s and 0s.

            Experience

            Typically, employers look for candidates with anywhere from 2 to 8 years of experience analyzing the development of cybersecurity policies and strategies. Experience with risk analysis is also valuable. Cybersecurity compliance analysts also need experience briefing clients and team members on technical, policy, and functional issues. 

            Certifications

            To help you skill up and get your foot in the door, pursuing a certification is a great idea. Here are some common certifications for cybersecurity compliance analysts (note that some certifications require a certain number of years of experience before they can be obtained).

                The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) A+ (Plus) Certification
                The International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)² Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).

            Knowledge

            As a cybersecurity compliance analyst, having a solid understanding of the basics—such as security frameworks, regulations, and standards—is key. You should have strong familiarity with security governance, compliance, and risk management frameworks such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST’s) Cybersecurity Framework, ISACA’s Control Objectives for Information Related Technology (COBIT) framework, and PCI DSS, to name a few. It’s also helpful to have knowledge of control assessment techniques, which include questionnaires, on-site visits, and penetration tests. Additional areas of expertise that are helpful, but not required, include data protection, access control, network and endpoint security, incident response and handling, vulnerability management, and firewalls. 

            Business Skills

            In addition to these technical skills, it’s also critical to hone your business skills. A huge part of being successful as a cybersecurity compliance analyst is effectively communicating and documenting requirements and findings, analyzing security gaps, and thinking strategically. You should know how to consult with various stakeholders in an organization, as well as demonstrate exemplary leadership and organizational skills. You should enjoy working as part of a team, researching answers to questions and problems, and paying close attention to detail. 

            Skills-first

            While traditional qualifications like education and certifications are important, cybersecurity is increasingly shifting toward a skills-first approach. This means employers are prioritizing demonstrated evidence of skills and abilities over formal credentials alone. To prepare for this changing landscape engage in team and independent projects that build proficiency in key skills. Document these projects in a portfolio of work (e.g., github, personal website) as tangible proof of your proficiency to send along with a resume and to showcase during interviews. Finally, during interviews, be prepared to demonstrate to employers that you possess the required skills they seek.

            Learning Objectives

            After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

                Explain the key features and tools in Grantmaking.
                Define some objects used to track information with Grantmaking.
                Describe examples of how to use Grantmaking at public sector and nonprofit organizations. 

            Note

            Salesforce offers both integrated platform solutions and managed packages. This module covers Grantmaking, an integrated solution in Salesforce.

            For more information about Grants Management, a managed package product that’s different from Grantmaking, complete the Grants Management Basics module.

            If you’re unsure which solution your organization uses, check with your Salesforce administrator.
            Goal: Grantmaking Greatness

            If you work for a grantmaking organization, or a nonprofit that delivers funding, you’re in the business of progress. Sure, the way you achieve those outcomes is by processing applications and granting money to people and organizations working toward your shared goals—but you’re looking for results.

            You need a solution that delivers, manages, and tracks funding programs to create stronger outcomes. A system that minimizes your time spent on process and compliance is key to success.

            Meet Grantmaking, a Salesforce solution for foundations, nonprofits, government agencies, and other public sector organizations that provide funding for a specific purpose. It’s an end-to-end grantmaking solution that drives efficiency, creates positive experiences for grantees, and invests in better outcomes.

            Grantmaking helps you manage the entire grantmaking process. It extends your Salesforce instance to give you a unified view of your funding programs throughout the planning, delivery, and evaluation stages. 

            Plus, a site template for Experience Cloud helps you create an online portal to communicate and collaborate with your grantees. Here’s an example home page based on the site template.

            The home page of a website for Mountain Rise Foundation.

            The home page presents the imaginary foundation's mission statement with options to access funding opportunities, the application process, awards, and more.

            In this Quick Look module, you gain an overview of Grantmaking and its features.
            The Salesforce Framework for Managing Grants

            Grantmaking adds to Salesforce’s relationship management tools with features designed to manage funding opportunities, set grant budgets, review grant applications, award grants, and manage disbursements on an ongoing basis.

            Let’s explore some objects that help you do that.

            Start by creating your funding programs in Salesforce using the Program object.

            Use the Budget object to define program spending. Budgets enable you to set and track grantmaking budgets for each of your programs, projects, or departments. For example, create budgets for the amount of money available to a program each year. Applicants can also submit project budgets when they apply, based on templates you configure.

            You manage available grant opportunities using the Funding Opportunity object. Funding opportunities can include descriptions of available grants, application instructions, and application start and end dates. You can display these opportunities through your Experience Cloud site, too.

            Funding opportunities can be related to application forms you create using the Action Plan Template, Individual Application Task, and Application Stage Definition objects, along with Omniscript, Flexcard, and Flow Builder.

            After an application is entered, you track it from start to finish with the Individual Application object.

            After an application is in the system, capture feedback from your team using the Application Review object. Standardize how your team works using built-in Salesforce automation tools and other features like action plans, document checklists, and approval processes.

            Then, manage your decisions using the Application Decision and Funding Award objects. Plus, track money sent to grantees using the Funding Disbursement object. Manage additional steps a grantee must take—like interim or annual reports—using the Funding Award Requirement object.

            Then track spending against the budget to neatly close the cycle.
            Grantmaking in Action

            By now you can imagine how Grantmaking fits into your organization’s grantmaking lifecycle. It helps to explore some examples, though.

            Let’s start by visiting the city of Cosville. Its small business administration focuses on boosting the municipality’s economy. However, it spends too much time on cumbersome administrative processes like collecting feedback and entering budget data. 

            With Grantmaking and an Experience Cloud site, Cosville can track reviews in one place to speed up decision making and automate manual tasks. Then it can work with grantees to file their budget numbers directly into Salesforce through an Experience Cloud portal. The result: More time spent on outcomes, less on data entry and chasing down reviewers.

            Now imagine the Mountain Rise Foundation (MRF), a private foundation. It has a small-but-mighty team that wants to build better relationships with grantees. By using Grantmaking and an Experience Cloud site, the foundation streamlines communications with applicants and grantees at every step of the grantmaking lifecycle. Grantmaking has transformed the grantee experience and optimized program outcomes.

            Can you think of how Grantmaking could fit into your organization?

                    After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
                        Describe the benefits of using leads.
                        Create leads.
                        Manage lead records.
                        Convert leads to opportunities.
                    The Leads Advantage

                    Every company is unique, but all companies want to find, sell to, and keep customers. Salesforce provides the tools you need to grow your pipeline and make more sales. A lead is one such tool. Leads help you track the people and companies that you define as prospective customers. 

                    With leads, you can better track, report on, and target marketing campaigns to prospects. Store your prospects as leads, and then once a lead becomes qualified, you can convert it to an account, contact, and, optionally, an opportunity.

                    Leads are especially useful if your company has two separate teams—one that handles lead generation and mass marketing and one that handles sales. The lead generation team can concentrate their work on the Leads tab, and the opportunity team can use the Account, Contact, and Opportunity tabs. 

                    Ready to take advantage of the leads tool? Let’s walk through the steps for creating, managing, and converting leads into opportunities.
                    Create a Lead

                    The first step in selling is to find customers. Here’s how to create a lead to help you do just that.
                        Click the Lead tab.
                        Click New.
                        Create a lead record for your potential customer by entering the lead's name, company, contact information, associated status, and other relevant information.
                        Note: Wondering how to determine lead assignments? Some companies assign leads automatically, such as by assigning leads to owners based on the lead’s geographical location. Other companies initially assign all new leads to a queue. Your Salesforce administrator will set up a lead assignment process that works for your company.
                        New Lead record

                        Click Save.

                    You can also add leads by importing a file into Salesforce or through an automatic process, such as a Web-to-Lead form that collects leads from your business website.
                    Manage Lead Records

                    As you work to qualify your leads—or turn them into opportunities—the lead’s record serves as your workspace. Use the workspace to track interactions with leads, check campaign history, and plan future activities.
                        The lead’s status is an important indicator that helps you track where each lead is in your sales process. The traditional way to update a lead’s status is to click Edit while viewing the lead’s record, change the Lead Status, and click Save. If the lead is involved in any marketing campaigns, they are listed in the Campaign History for the lead.
                        Review the lead’s Details tab to find and update information about the lead.
                        Use the lead’s Activity tab to log your calls and emails to help you remember what you talked about and how the lead responded. Plan for the future by creating Tasks or Events.
                        Connect with your coworkers to ask questions, seek advice, or provide information on the lead’s Chatter tab. The Chatter feed for the record also shows when you create activities.
                    Convert Leads to Opportunities

                    Qualifying a lead indicates that you believe the lead has a use for and interest in your products, and that a sale is a definite possibility. The exact criteria for qualifying and converting leads is part of your company’s unique business process.

                    When you qualify a lead, you can convert the lead record into an opportunity. You then work your opportunity until you close the deal.

                    Here’s how you convert your lead record into an opportunity.
                        On the Leads tab, open your lead record.
                        Click Convert.
                        In the Account section, create an account from the Company name entered for the lead. If you’re converting a lead who works for an existing account, select the existing account instead.
                        In the Contact section, create a contact from the name entered for the lead. If the contact exists, select the existing contact instead.
                        In the Opportunity section, enter a descriptive name for the new opportunity so it’s easy to identify the potential deal.
                        Check that the Record Owner and Converted Status are correct.
                        Click Convert.

                    Look at that! You’ve created a lead and qualified it as an opportunity. You’re on your way to closing more deals.
